    <h1 class="title">What You Need To Have A Web Site</h1>
    <p>So you want to have your own website?</p>

<p>Let's say you've made up your mind that you want your own website. I know from personal experience that getting started is a daunting task. Allow me to simplify things for you...</p>

<h2>The Things You Need To Have A Web Site</h2>

<p>Here is the short list of what you need to have a web site. I'll delve into more detail after.</p>

<ul>
<li>A Web Host</li>
<li>A Domain Name</li>
<li>A Web Site</li>
</ul>


<h2>Web Hosts</h2>

<p>A web host is a computer that's constantly connected to the internet. It hosts your files and allows them to be accessed via the internet.</p>

<p>Let's break web hosts down into two different categories. <strong>Free</strong> and <strong>Paid</strong>. I'll cover each type briefly and go over the <strong>pros</strong> and <strong>cons</strong>.</p>

<h3>Free Web Hosts</h3>

<p>There are a number of services that offer free web hosting. Typically these services also come with easy to use tools to help you create your website. These can be good solutions for getting your first website, but they do come with drawbacks.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wix.com">Wix</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.zymic.com/free-web-hosting/">Zymic</a></p>

<p><a href="http://xtreemhost.com/">XtreemHost</a></p>

<h4>Free Web Host Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>They're free!</li>
<li>They are typically easy to navigate</li>
<li>It's nice to get your feet wet before making a commitment</li>
<li>Some services (like Blogger and Facebook) allow you to connect to members of the community (free marketing)</li>
</ul>


<h4>Free Web Host Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>You don't get your own domain name (instead of www.mywebsite.com you'll have www.mywebsite.blogger.com)</li>
<li>They don't look very professional</li>
<li>There are always limitations (most of the things you'll want your web site to do will be considered upgrades and will cost)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Paid Web Hosts</h3>

<p>Paid web hosting is really the way you want to go if you want people to take your website seriously. Keep in mind that paid web hosts and free web hosts are not mutually exclusive of eachother. Particularly services like Blogger and Facebook are great free tools that can be used to market your paid web site.</p>

<h4>Examples (that I recommend)</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a></p>

<p><a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a></p>

<h4>Paid Web Host Pros</h4>

<ul>
<li>Your own domain name (www.yourwebsite.com)</li>
<li>The ability to do anything you want on your site</li>
<li>Your own web space for hosting files</li>
</ul>


<h4>Paid Web Host Cons</h4>

<ul>
<li>They cost money (typically between $4 and $10 a month)</li>
<li>They take a little more work to set up</li>
</ul>


<h5>Conclusion</h5>

<p>If you want people to take your website seriously, and it isn't just a blog, you should go with a <strong>Paid Web Host</strong>. If you're just going to be blogging, it might better to get your start with a free blogging platform such as blogger.</p>

<h2>Domain Names</h2>

<p>This one is pretty straight forward. As we already covered a web host is a computer that holds the files we view as websites. Now, the way the world accesses these files is by opening a web browser and pointing it at the computer via its IP Address.</p>

<p>Can you imagine a world where instead of typing in http://www.google.com we had to type in http://74.125.225.20/ (try it! it works). Pretty tough to remember, right?</p>

<p>The answer to this problem comes in the form of domain names. Again, to over-simplify, a domain name allows you to have a unique set of characters and numbers that can replace your host's IP Address and allow people to more easily find your website.</p>

<h3>Free Domain Names</h3>

<p>Very similar to web hosts, domain names can be acquired for free but there are drawbacks. If you get a free domain name it will most likely be a sub-domain or an extension (something like yourname.blogger.com or blogger.com/yourname). Again, this makes your website seem less professional and you don't get many of the Search Engine Optimization benefits you would have if you bought your own domain name.</p>

<h3>Paid Domain Names</h3>

<p>On the bright side of things, domain names are cheap! They cost about $10 per year and are worth every penny! Some people say it's best to buy your domain name from a separate company than the one you use for your hosting. This certainly has its advantages but if you're really just looking to simplify things you probably should just buy them both at the same time. Additionally, companies like <strong>Dreamhost</strong> (mentioned earlier) usually throw in your domain name for free when you sign up for a hosting account.</p>

<h2>A Web Site</h2>

<p>Alright, now you're all set up with a hosting account and have purchased your own domain name. The last thing you need is a web site (the files you put on your web server). This really could / should be its own thread but let me sum up a few different routes you can take to achieve this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Many Web Hosts have a "1-click installs" tab. If you go there, you likely will be able to install a Content Management System like WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla on your web site easily. If you take this route, you'll be able to get a site up and running in no time and start writing your content.</li>
<li>You can follow my <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/how-to-install-wordpress/">How To Install WordPress</a> tutorial</li>
<li>You can hire a web designer (see my post on <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/how-much-does-a-website-cost-part-2/">How Much Websites Cost</a> )</li>
<li>You can make your own static page with HTML and CSS</li>
</ol>
