    <h1 class="title">WordPress Auto-Post to Facebook - The Right Way</h1>
    <p>Looking to have your WordPress blog automatically update your Facebook page?</p>

<p>Let's compare options.</p>

<p>tl;dr  -   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/RSS.Graffiti">Use http://www.facebook.com/RSS.Graffiti</a></p>

<h2>Option 1 - Simple Facebook Connect</h2>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> A WordPress plugin developed to allow all sorts of Facebook / WordPress connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong> It gets the job done.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>It's a massively big plug-in.</li>
<li>It'll slow your website load by a good deal of time.</li>
<li>It's a bit difficult to set-up.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>My Experience:</strong> When I was first looking to accomplish this functionality. This was the only option that I saw on the market. I downloaded and installed the plug-in, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work. Finally I found a good tutorial floating around the internet and go moving. The functionality worked just as expected. I was frustrated that I had to create my own Facebook app and a bunch of other stuff but hey, it worked.</p>

<p>After I got everything set and working I pretty much forgot about it for a while. Lately I've been trying to figure out how to improve my website's performance and I noticed that the four slowest things loading on my website were all related to this plugin. It was pushing me to an unacceptable about of lag so I had to look for other options.</p>

<h2>Option 2 - RSS Graffiti</h2>

<p><strong>What is it:</strong> A Facebook app that takes data from your RSS feed and pushes it to your Facebook wall.</p>

<p><em>RSS feeds are automatically generated by WordPress. They can be found at http://www.yourwebsite.com/feed.
</em>This plug-in can post to your personal wall or a fan page.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong> Super easy and it gets the job done.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong> Nothing so far. I mean it doesn't slow down your website because it doesn't go on your website. I'll update if I get frustrated and switch again.</p>

<h2>Option 3 - Networked Blogs</h2>

<p>I don't know if it's just me but I can not bring myself to use Networked Blogs. Maybe it's just me but I can't get past the sign up screen. Anyone have experience with this method and want to share let me know and I'll add it to the post!</p>
