    <h1 class="title">Audio's Place on the Web</h1>
    <p>I started off this week reading Luke Wroblewski's <em>Mobile First<strong>.</strong></em></p>

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2356" title="mobile_first" src="/images/mobile_first.jpeg" alt="" /></a></div>


<p>If you haven't read it already, you really should; It's an incredible read.</p>

<p>Anyway, Luke got me thinking about so much. Mobile technology, native apps vs. mobile websites but what I found most interesting was his ideas of designing applications that make use of the new ways people use mobile devices. I'm talking about swiping, tapping, tilting websites.</p>

<h2>Audio on a Blog</h2>

<p>Today, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.damienelsing.com/">Damien Elsing's Blog</a> and noticed something strange on his sidebar:</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2358" title="voice_message" src="/images/voice_message.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>Check that out, on the right side there is a tooltip asking you to leave an audio message as feedback on his blog.</p>

<h3>The First Step</h3>

<p>My immediate reaction was that asking for audio feedback is a bad idea. Thinking about recording a message on Damien's blog seemed like an awkward experience. It also filled my with questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the experience going to be like?</li>
<li>Will I have a chance to listen to my message before I send it?</li>
<li>Who's going to be listening to this message?</li>
<li>How many blog readers are properly set up to leave an audio message?</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Reality</h3>

<p>Curiosity got the best of me and I clicked the leave feedback button which answered a few of my questions. It seems like you can record before sending and the technology that Damien is using for audio recording is Adobe's Flash Player.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm a bit too security conscious to give Adobe permissions to my mic and webcam so I didn't leave a message. However just because we have barriers today doesn't mean that audio comments are bust.</p>

<p>I think that if more blogs and websites started offering blogging comments it could be a really great means for 1 way communication. Text seems to be advantageous in that it can be read by everyone who stops through.</p>

<p>Any of you using audio on your websites? Care to share your experience?</p>
