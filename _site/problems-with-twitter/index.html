<h2>Twitter Never Works Correctly</h2>

<p>Personally, I love <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>. I use it everyday to stay connected with friends, blogs and heroes alike. It's really one of the most incredible online services of the 21st century. That being said...</p>

<p>I always seem to be having problems with Twitter. I searched around and can't seem to find anyone else writing about this so I figured I would.</p>

<h2>My Problems With Twitter</h2>

<h3>Scenario 1 - The Numbers Don't Add Up</h3>

<p>Have any of you had this happen? You look at a blog post and there is one of those awesome little tweet buttons. In the box it says that this blog post has been tweeted 100 times. You click inside the box to see who has been tweeting about this blog post and you get a Twitter error saying no tweets can be found with links to that blog post.</p>

<p>I mean, understandably the numbers can't always line up. There are glitches and expired tweets and any number of variables that can throw the count off. But it really seems to me like the numbers are <strong>never</strong> close to lining up.</p>

<h3>Scenario 2 - That Person Doesn't Exist</h3>

<p>Here's another one that gets me. I sometimes spend upwards of 10 minutes trying to find someone on Twitter. Even if I know their username exactly sometimes I just have to do the same search 4 or 5 times before the user will come up.</p>

<h2>Is It Just Me</h2>

<p>Is everyone else having these problems too?</p>

<p>What other problems with Twitter are you having?</p>

<p>Share them with me in the comments and I'll add them to the list!</p>
