    <h1 class="title">Wordpress Plugins I love, but can't find a use for</h1>
    <p>While designing websites, I sometimes stumble upon great Wordpress plugins that I just can't seem to find a use for. This post is intended to both spread the word about these great plugins, and ask readers if they've found a way to use these plugins.</p>

<h2>1. Animated Twitter Bird</h2>

<p>I recently stumbled upon this <a href="http://www.techlineinfo.com/wordpress-plugin-displays-animated-twitter-bird/">Animated Twitter Bird</a> plugin by Sujith of  <a href="http://www.techlineinfo.com/">Techline Info</a> . Twitter is quickly becoming one of the most important marketing tools in a business' repertoire.  Although there are many great plugins to advertise your Twitter account on your website, I haven't yet seen one that is so... well, cute.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img title="animated-twitter-bird_thumb" src="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/images/animated-twitter-bird_thumb.jpg" /></div>


<p>Perhaps the best thing about this plugin is that it's literally plug-and-play. You just grab it from their website or the 'Add New' Plugins section of your Wordpress site, enter your twitter account name and it starts working. The little blue bird shows up automatically on all of your pages. It flies around your screen on each page load and lands on one of your elements. This may look a little off at times but for the most part it looks great!</p>

<h2>2. Easing Slider</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.easingslider.matthewruddy.com/">Easing Slider </a>by Matthew Ruddy is an exceptional image / content slider. Perhaps the flashiest free one on the market. The plugin comes with both a free and premium version, both of which I have used. It looks great right out of the box and the administration panel is quite easy to use. There are multiple sliding effects, shadow choices, and a multitude of other settings.</p>

<p>So, with such a rave review, why is it I can't seem to find a use for this plugin you ask? Honestly, it steals the show. I'm sure it doesn't help much that graphic design is far from my area of expertise. This causes me to rely heavily on my CSS skills and this animated picture slider often comes across as 'too much'. I'd love to see some examples of this plugin on a site where it can truly shine.</p>

<h2>3. Premier Contact Forms</h2>

<p>Ok, so I've seen a lot of great looking contact forms out there that come fully loaded with endless options and features. One of the forms I've had the pleasure of using is <a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/">Gravity Forms</a>.  Now, this very well may show my novice as a Wordpress designer but I have yet to run into a project that <a href="http://contactform7.com/">Contact Form 7</a> can't handle. Admittedly, Gravity Forms had a nicer interface but I just do not understand paying for a premiere plugin when Contact Form 7 is readily available for free. Perhaps someone can shed some light on this for me.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, only three for the time being but I hope to come back and add to this post whenever I find a great WP plugin I can't find a use for.  Meanwhile, if any of you have plugins to add, explanations to give or websites using these plugins to show, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
