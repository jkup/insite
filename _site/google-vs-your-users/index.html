    <h1 class="title">Google vs. Your Users</h1>
    <p>Undoubtedly two of the hottest topics in the web industry are <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> and <strong>User Experience. </strong>When done well, it is possible to find a magnificent balance and create a successful website. Unfortunately, this balance is difficult to come by and often leaves sites tipping too far to one side. Before we go any further let's define these terms:</p>

<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ):</strong></p>

<p>The process of adjusting the content, structure, etc,of a website so that it will be displayed prominently by a search engine.**</p>

<p><strong>User Experience ( UX ):</strong></p>

<p>A subset of the field of <a title="Experience design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_design">experience design</a> that pertains to the creation of the architecture and interaction models that affect <a title="User experience" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">user experience</a> of a device or system.</p>

<h2><strong>A Tale Of Opposites</strong></h2>

<p>Although these two concepts can work together harmoniously, they are often each other's worst enemies. <strong>SEO</strong> can be simplified and defined as <em>Designing For Computers.</em> <strong>UX</strong> on the other hand can be over-simplified and described as <em>Designing For Humans.</em></p>

<h3><strong>The Battle Begins</strong></h3>

<p>Let's take a look at an important part of any website, the headlines. Whether your  website is a blog that needs killer headlines to get clicks or a corporate business page -- your headlines need to generate interest.</p>

<h3><strong>So, What's The Problem?</strong></h3>

<p>Let's pretend we're sitting in a room with an <strong>SEO</strong> expert and a <strong>UX</strong> designer. We tell them we're writing a blog article about WordPress and we need their help picking a killer headline. The thought processes would look something like this.</p>

<p><em>SEO Expert: Let me do keyword analysis and figure out which WordPress related terms are the most viable for Search Engine traffic. We'll put the list together and find a title that will guarantee you a lot of hits on Google.</em></p>

<p>This would probably land us a headline like: <strong>Introduction To WordPress.</strong></p>

<p><em>UX Expert: Let me analyze the demographics of your website visitors, after I figure out as much as I can I'll write you something snappy that will guarantee clicks.</em></p>

<p>This would probably land us a headline like: <strong>Forget Everything You Thought You Knew About WordPress.</strong></p>

<p>Now let's analyze these titles.</p>

<h3><strong>The SEO Expert</strong></h3>

<p>Now SEO provides great benefit to websites, but there is a drawback. Again, let's over-simplify. Search Engine Optimization is a great tool, it will help you attract new visitors that wouldn't otherwise find your website. By showing up higher in the search engines you can reach a larger audience.</p>

<p>The drawback to this is robotic content that won't keep users around for long. While attracting new users is always important, keeping them around and loyal is what leads to <em>real conversions.</em></p>

<h3><strong>The UX Designer</strong></h3>

<p>UX is a fantastic field that can make all the difference in your websites success. A great UX designer can create websites that serve their intended purpose beautifully. Whether your website aims to sell products or services or inform and educate; UX designers act as a blanket between humans and computers.</p>

<p>All of this is great, but it doesn't do a bit of good if no one ever finds your website. You can have great content and a wonderful design but one way or another you need to get that initial burst of traffic or it's all moot.</p>

<h2><strong>The Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Websites have become devalued, the entire industry has. Many people gawk at a $2,000 price tag on a well designed site. If you are serious about the website you are creating, you should at least consider the benefits of hiring a UX consultant and an SEO marketing firm.</p>
