    <h1 class="title">5 Linux Problems You'll Never Have Using Windows Or A Mac</h1>
    <h3><strong>1. Insert A Device And Nothing Happens</strong></h3>

<p>Here's the scenario. You're getting ready to watch a movie. You sit down on your couch and pull your laptop over. You boot it up and pop in the DVD. Nothing happens.</p>

<p>It's all too common with Linux Distributions. Bleeding edge distro's like Ubuntu or the super stable packages like Slackware, sometimes for seemingly no reason a USB stick, CD, DVD or other device will just not register.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Upgrade / Update And Your Computer Won't Start</strong></h3>

<p>This is the first and foremost reason I cannot take Linux distributions seriously.  This is also the reason I'm writing this post. I've had Ubuntu installed on one of my desktops for 2 years. Today ( 11/5/2011 ) I decided the servers were probably open enough to upgrade my installation to 11.10. I set it all in motion and let it do its thing. When it was done updating, just as usual, it required a reboot so I hit restart. It hasn't booted since.</p>

<p>I've tried safe mode, memory testing, dpckg, fdsk and everything else I could think of to figure out what's wrong and nothing works. That is something that would <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span></strong> happen with Windows or Mac.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Visit A Website Or Use An App That Doesn't Support Your Operating System</strong></h3>

<p>This is also extremely annoying although I know the blame lies with both parties. I <strong>hate</strong> that I can't watch my Netflix movies on a Linux machine. I hate that I can't access most College websites or use a lot of my favorite online applications.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Never Have The Right Codec, Driver, Libraries Or Dependencies</strong></h3>

<p>This is just super annoying. When I install some vanilla, ultra-lightweight Linux distribution, not having all the right software is par for the course. However, when I install a 700 MB Ubuntu install, and it can't play movies that makes me furious.</p>

<p>This problem is also two fold. I've run into semi-similar issues on Windows and Mac, but those operating systems always point you in the right direction. Most Linux distributions won't even tell you what specifically you're missing. Let alone show you how to get it.</p>

<h3><strong>5. Every Problem Requires 4 Hours In The Terminal Doing Things You Don't Understand</strong></h3>

<p>Here's the real kicker. Not only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will</span> all of the above things go wrong at some point in time, but they will take <strong>ages</strong> to fix. Most solutions go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>1-2 hours searching forums, posting on message boards and chat rooms until you isolate the problem.</li>
<li>1-2 hours figuring out the actual solution and how to do it with your distro / version.</li>
<li>1 hour implementing the changes, this involves a lot of finger crossing and prayer.</li>
</ul>


<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

<p>Linux is an awesome operating system. I've been a user for years and there are <strong>so </strong>many things I just love about it. However, there are so many time when one of these problems comes up and I need to take a break from Linux and go back to my Mac or PC.</p>

<p>What Operating System do you all use? Tell me one thing you like about it and one thing you hate!</p>
