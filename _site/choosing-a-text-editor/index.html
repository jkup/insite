<h2>It Doesn't Matter</h2>

<p>Bet you weren't expecting that, but it's really the truth.</p>

<p>As programmers, we use text editors to write code. A good text editor will help you do that more powerfully and efficiently. The thing is, 90% of text editors on the market today do both of those things magnificently.</p>

<p>What really matters it that you identify the features you need in a modern text editor and then choose any of the dozens of editors that offer those features.</p>

<h2>Must Have Features</h2>

<ol>
<li>File Browser</li>
<li>Syntax Highlighting</li>
<li>Automatic Indentation</li>
<li>Line Numbering</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Find and Replace</li>
<li>Fun Plugins</li>
</ol>


<p>This is what I've come up with so far as my must-haves. 'Fun Plugins' is a bit vague but I just mean your editor should have a good developer community adding great features and keeping up with new ones.</p>

<h2>My Suggestions</h2>

<p>I think you should try as many editors as possible until you find one that just clicks with you. Also, I think trying a lot of editors is good because you never know when you're going to find yourself in a situation that requires the use of a particular editor.</p>

<p>That being said, I think you should try:</p>

<ul>
<li>vim</li>
<li>emacs</li>
<li>Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>Netbeans</li>
<li>Gedit</li>
<li>TextMate</li>
</ul>


<h2>Try Them All</h2>

<p>I find it quite enjoyable to play around with multiple editors. They each offer something unique and I think you'll find yourself with multiple favorites.</p>

<p>Any other editor suggestions? Leave 'em in the comments!</p>
