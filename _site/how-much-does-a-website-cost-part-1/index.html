    <h1 class="title">How Much Does A Website Cost - Part 1</h1>
    <p>When I first started <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com">Insite Design Lab</a> one of the most difficult decisions I had to make was how much to charge for web design. I found very few resources online detailing prices and the difference between web design firms, so I've decided to write my own post based on my experience in attempt to answer the questions "how much does a website cost?". I suppose there are two important things to consider when choosing your budget. The first is what type of designer / design team would best take care of your needs and the other of course is your budget. This will be part 1 of a 2-series post and will cover factors that can be used to determine what type of designer you should choose.</p>

<h2>Choosing your designer</h2>

<p>With so many different types of designers out there, it is important to understand the pros and cons of each type and figure out which would work best for your project. Before we answer the question on how much a website costs, we need to understand the different people who make their living building websites. For the sake of this article I'm going to break designers down into three different categories: <strong>Freelancers</strong>, <strong>Web Design Companies</strong> and <strong>Marketing Firms</strong>.</p>

<h2>Freelance Web Designer</h2>

<p>Freelancers are typically 1-2 person teams that work out of their home. They might have other jobs during the day and take on web design gigs after-hours. This isn't to say that they are less qualified or talented than companies (Some of the most talented people in the field are freelancers.) It is merely to say that you will most likely be dealing with a single person and you may forfeit some of the benefits you get from working with a professional company. Pros to working with freelancers are that they often cost much less than web design companies and you will probably be in constant communication with the person who is actually working on your project. Cons to freelancers are they tend to be more specialized, and may only provide a select number of services, meaning that you may have to go elsewhere if you would like additional functionality on your project.</p>

<h2>Web Design Company</h2>

<p>Web Design Companies vary in size and services. Typically they range from 3 to 20 people and offer several different services. Often, web design companies have a few all around people, complemented by specialists. One of the biggest perks of working with a web design company is that, at any given time, you will likely be dealing with the person on their team best qualified for the situation. They often have sales people to talk out the details with you, artists to provide you with professional designs, Project Managers to make sure your project is completed on time and professional programmers that can handle projects of any size.The two major drawbacks of these larger companies are that they typically charge a lot more, and may not provide as intimate an experience as you would get working with a freelance designer.</p>

<h2>Marketing Firms</h2>

<p>More and more, web design companies attempt to encompass a multitude of related services in an effort to turn themselves into a one-stop shop for your digital and business needs. In addition to web design, these companies often times offer additional services such as Search Engine Optimization, PR campaigns, Social Network Marketing and a plethora of real-life marketing services. These companies often have a number of great connections and employees that can truly handle your companies entire online campaign. The pros to these companies are that they can handle any size project and often have great ideas that you may not have considered to improve your traffic and online presence. The cons are that these companies generally charge in the tens of thousands for their services and you may be looking at many months before any deliverables are ready.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When beginning the search for a web designer, it is important to really consider the scope of the project when choosing your designer. Some important things to think about are:
+ Do I need a website that is extensible, that can grow with my company?
+ Do I need more than just static pages? For example, e-commerce, a newsletter, a forum or a blog?
+ Do I want an intimate relationship with my designer? Or, would I rather work with a large group of professionals?
+ What timeline do I need for my project?</p>

<h2>Now, Let's Talk Money</h2>
