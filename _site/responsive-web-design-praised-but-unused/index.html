<p>Responsive web design is no doubt a hot topic for today's web designers. For those that aren't familiar with the concept it involves using A <a href="http://960.gs/">Fluid Grid</a>, <a href="http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/">Flexible Images</a> and <a href="http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-media-queries">CSS3 Media Queries</a> to create websites that respond to screen size and adapt accordingly.</p>

<p>Shameless plug -- Check out my new ( responsive ) <a href="http://www.jonkuperman.com">personal website!</a></p>

<p>To simplify, this means that you ( the designer) can create websites that rearrange and re-size content based on screen size. So, on a large screen you may want a big full content area and a large ad-filled sidebar. Whereas on a cell phone, maybe you want to drop the sidebar and just have the content area fit to fill the screen. Well? It's super do-able, check out those links!</p>

<h2>This Is Not That Post</h2>

<p>If you're looking for information on creating responsive websites, the three links above will be a great start. This is, however, not that post. This post is more of a question to the web design community. If Responsive Design is so great, and makes experiencing your website much better, then why aren't more people using it? More importantly, why are all of these blogs like <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> publishing books about how great the technology is, but not using it themselves?</p>

<h2>I Mostly Understand</h2>

<p>Now, I do get it. My website has &gt;100 visitors per day. If I want to re-design it's really not a big deal. I can change the look and feel of the site and even a bit of downtime is not likely to affect anyone. I do understand that websites like A List Apart and Smashing Magazine don't have this luxury. I also understand that a lot more goes into developing websites with custom applications and tens of thousands of pages, but I think there is still a small point to it all.</p>

<p>I suppose, to me, it seems the same as being lectured on how great American cars are by a race car driver that drives a Toyota. I mean, if they are really that great, and you really spend most of your time in your car / talking about web design than why aren't you using it? I mean, what better way to support a new technology than adopting it, right?</p>

<h2>Complete Hypocrisy</h2>

<p>I know, I know. Here I am talking about how much I love responsive design and how people shouldn't talk it if they aren't using it and I don't have a single responsive element or media query on my whole page. It's true.</p>

<p>But but, not to worry. I'm taking my own advice and will soon be launching a completely re-designed and responsive website! It should be live by November 10th, 2011.</p>

<p>That it all, does anyone actually read this thing?</p>
