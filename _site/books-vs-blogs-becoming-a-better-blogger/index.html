    <p>Before you write your next blog post -- ask yourself this question:</p>

<blockquote>Has someone written a better version of this post?</blockquote>


<p>Chances are someone has. I'm not saying that you shouldn't write the post, just be aware that you aren't a first mover on this topic, and people looking to learn more about your topic should probably check out the other article.</p>

<p>Just to make a point, I did this little exercise before writing this post and found that someone in fact had already <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2009/03/be-a-better-blogger-stop-readi.html">written this post better</a> than I'm going to.</p>

<p>No matter what blogging strategy you follow, it is generally accepted that your blog should be <strong>worth reading</strong> in some way. So, if someone smarted or with better writing style has already written on your topic, either forget about it or construct a blog post that still has merit in the blogosphere despite your competition.</p>

<h2>Blogarrhea</h2>

<p>In the article linked to above, Ted Dziuba uses the term <em>Blogarrhea</em> to reference bloggers writing articles on information gained exclusively from other blogs. He then calls for a <em>Read More, Write Less</em> strategy to be incorporated by bloggers, I've taken this to heart.</p>

<p>I'm about a month and a half away from my 1 year blogging anniversary and I've learned a lot along the way. When I first starting writing articles, I -- like many others -- was absolutely obsessed with traffic, comments and social shares. I spent countless hours surfing the web looking for tips and tricks to get more people to my website. I tried link building, comment swapping and all the other blogging gimmicks.  However it wasn't until reading Ted's article that I never contemplated why readers <strong>would want</strong> to read my articles.</p>

<h2>A Simple Exercise</h2>

<p>If you're looking to make your blog more successful, here are a few questions you should contemplate -- they might help you figure out why you're not doing as well as you'd like.</p>

<p>Don't be shy, answer these questions honestly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you want more traffic? ( Monetize with advertisements? Get recognition? Make friends via comments? Build your resume? )</li>
<li>Why should people read your blog? ( Are you funny or controversial? A master in your industry? Do your articles save people time? Help people gain insight? )</li>
<li>How can people find your blog? ( Do you pay for advertising? Have you been around for a while? Do you leave quality comments on other blogs in your industry? Do you show up well on Google? )</li>
</ul>


<h2>Books vs. Blogs</h2>

<p>After thinking about those questions and coming up with some surprising answers, I decided to take a small hiatus from blogging. I took a break from both reading and writing articles for about a month, taking time to think about what I really wanted from my own blog.</p>

<p>I had just received some <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/">amazing books </a>for Christmas and spent my extra timing reading through them. As I read through these great books, it dawned on me how much more information is packed into a published book than an ( average ) blog article. It isn't that I think blog articles can't be incredible learning tools -- obviously they can. It's all about averages, the average web design book is going to have more original thought and useful information than the average post. That's how most of these people get published, they're ( typically ) the best in the industry and have something worth saying.</p>

<h2>Not All Blogs Are Bad</h2>

<p>Reading books is better for your inspiration than reading blogs. It's a simple truth that anything you learn through reading blogs has already been written on a blog. However, getting your inspiration from reading other blogs isn't all bad. As important as original thought is, it's also important for intelligent people to weigh in on current issues. If you are a real asset to your industry, you should stay current on the latest news and voice your opinions on anything contentious. I think I'm finding a nice balance with doing about 75% of my reading with books written by authorities in my field and 25% of my reading on popular blogs just to stay up to date.</p>

<h2>Need Blog Inspiration?</h2>

<p>If you're suffering from writers block, my first recommendation is to not write. Wait until you have something that needs to be said, don't blog just for the hell of it. However, I understand that some people don't have that luxury. Maybe you have to write regular posts to keep your fans, boost your SEO ranking or maybe it's your job. If this is the case I've found some pretty cool ways to get inspired without producing <strong>Blogarrhea. </strong>These ideas apply to web design / programming -- my field -- but I'm sure you can apply the basic idea to your field as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read a book, write a review.</li>
<li>Search Github for some not-well-known piece of software, write a tutorial.</li>
<li>Create something, then write about how awesome it is.</li>
<li>Take a look at forums and help sections, find an unanswered question and answer it with a blog post.</li>
</ul>


<p>Happy Blogging!</p>
