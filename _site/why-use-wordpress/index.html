    <h1 class="title">Why Use WordPress</h1>
    <p>I decided to write this article (Why Use WordPress)  because over the last year I have become a <strong>HUGE</strong> WordPress fanatic. I use it everyday, I love it more than I have ever loved a piece of software. It is beautiful easy to use, customize, theme and develop on. I truly believe that every website should be using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Content Management System</a>  and most websites should be using <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. This article is intended for:</p>

<ul>
<li>People who are wanting a website</li>
<li>People who already have a website but want more from it</li>
<li>People already using WordPress</li>
<li>People using other Content Management Systems</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Use WordPress For People Wanting A Website</h2>

<p>If you are in the market for a website, Wordpress should really be something you look into. Especially for people who are newly joining the world of webmasters, the process of maintaining a website can actually be very simple (or even fun!) depending on what sort of system you are working with. So many times I hear potential clients dreading the responsibility that comes along with maintaining a website. It is perhaps the most rewarding part of my job when I finish the website and show them how much of a breeze a WordPress site can be to update.</p>

<p>WordPress websites are great if you want to easily be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create / Edit / Delete your own posts and pages</li>
<li>Have access to a seemingly limitless supply of free plugins and widgets (one click installs!)</li>
<li>Have access to a seemingly limitless supply (redundant, I know but it seemed worth it's own bullet point) of free or cheap themes!</li>
<li>Be a part of the WordPress Community</li>
<li>Know you have an extensible website that can grow with your company</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Use WordPress For People Who Already Have A Website</h2>

<p>The web is changing. It is no longer acceptable to merely put up a website and leave it for years. Design evolves, trends change and it is painfully obvious when your website hasn't received an update in a while. This is where WordPress comes in. Whether it's upgrading your theme, adding some new plug-ins or starting a blog, you can be sure your website will stay looking fresh with WordPress. The WordPress team is constantly putting out updates making the software run better and easier to use. Most of these changes are a simple click of a button and you can be sure your website stays fresh and accurate.</p>

<p>You should consider moving your website to WordPress if you want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep up to date with the latest web trends</li>
<li>Have Web 2.0 functionality (like a blog or a forum)</li>
<li>Easily be able to add / edit / remove content from any page</li>
<li>Allow multiple users to contribute to your website</li>
</ul>


<h2>What More You Could Be Doing With Your WordPress Website</h2>

<p>Everyday I meet people who are already using WordPress but are unaware of just how powerful and easy to customize it can be. Although it comes out of the box as a powerful blogging platform and CMS it can be easily manipulated to serve any purpose you would like.</p>

<p>You should spend more time with your WordPress website if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Haven't already used it as a Content Management System</li>
<li>Haven't checked out the enormous<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/"> plugin repository</a></li>
<li>Don't know how easily you can tweak the PHP files (You may need to hire a programmer, but working on a WordPress site is a breeze)</li>
<li>Haven't joined the WordPress community</li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Use WordPress For People Using Other Content Management Systems</h2>

<p>Ok, before I start this I know I'm going to get flack for it, but that's alright with me. I've used Joomla and Drupal in the past and understand both their value as well as their importance in the website realm. That being said, I truly believe that 95% of website (not including e-commerce) would be better off switching to WordPress. I believe that all pros and cons aside, WordPress is the easiest Content Management System to grasp for the <em>average user.</em> Plug-in's are easier to install, themes easier to change, and content easier to manipulate. I know many people for example using Drupal that boast about it's speed, modularity and beautiful simplicity, but most websites aren't run by developers. They are run by users, and most of these users don't share <em>our</em> passion for web design.</p>

<p>I believe you should consider switching to WordPress if you</p>

<ul>
<li>Feel confused or overwhelmed by your current Content Management System</li>
<li>Want more access to support forums and Q&amp;A sites</li>
<li>Are always afraid your going to break something when in the "back-end" of your website</li>
<li>Want to feel in control of your website without spending too much time learning the technical side</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, I think people who disagree with my points on this subject should check out the article <a href="http://stylizedweb.com/2011/06/02/6-things-disenters-dont-know-about-wordpress/">6 Things Dissenters Don't Know About WordPress</a> over at <a href="http://stylizedweb.com">stylizedweb.com</a></p>
