    <p>Often times, I hear people talking about what life was like before the internet. How people interacted with each other. How they got directions, communicated, purchased goods and services and so on. While I'd love to write an article on the topic, I feel like it's much too broad. So, instead I want to talk about some of the inventions that make the internet so enjoyable.</p>

<h2>1. Tabbed Browsing</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-full wp-image-274 aligncenter" title="tabbed_browsing" src="/images/tabbed_browsing.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>No matter how hard I try, I cannot honestly remember my life before tabbed-browsing. I vaguely remember desktop screens littered with dozens of internet explorer windows.  Seriously, take a minute to consider how much better your life is due to browsers with tab capabilities.</p>

<h2>2. Google</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-full wp-image-279 aligncenter" title="google_logo" src="/images/google_logo.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>With over 100 million searches per day, it may seem unnecessary to mention Google in this list. However, I think that while the search giant's usefulness is obvious to all, the necessity for organization on the internet may be less-so.  It is predicted that there are over 250,000,000 active websites on the internet right now, and without search engines like Google, it would be neigh impossible to find what you are looking for.</p>

<h2>3. PHP (and other scripting languages)</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-medium wp-image-280 aligncenter" title="php-logo" src="/images/php-logo.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>A while back, I was working on a static web page consisting of more than 50 pages. The client I was helping wanted me to install <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> on their site. After about the 40th copy / paste, it really sunk in how much I appreciate the ability to have dynamic headers that span every page of your website.</p>

<h2>4. Firebug / Inspect Element</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-full wp-image-284 aligncenter" title="inspect_element" src="/images/inspect_element.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>So, this one's more catered to developers, but it's still an incredible idea. The ability to view and edit HTML, CSS, Javascript on the fly is an incredible tool.  Additionally, these programs come with a robust set of advanced features allowing you to debug, locate errors, and view the DOM.</p>

<h2>5. Content Management Systems</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-full wp-image-287 aligncenter" title="wordpress_logo" src="/images/wordpress_logo.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>Yet another great creation that I work with every day. Content management systems allow designers to build complex website that are a breeze to update. I love working with Content Management Systems (CMS)  because as much as I love designing great websites, it brings me even greater joy to build sites that my clients can, and more importantly are excited to use. I work primarily with <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>, a popular and free CMS which started as a blogging platform and has transformed into a fully featured system allowing for everything including blogging, e-commerce, forums, static websites and much much more.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I work online every day. I deal with frustrations and buggy software and slow programs. Sometimes, I think it's important to take a step back and realize what great advancements have been made in recent years and how <strong>fun</strong> the internet has become to use.</p>
