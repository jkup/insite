<h2>Twitter For Readers</h2>

<p>When I first started using Twitter, I had nothing to say.</p>

<p>Let me preface my introduction to Twitter.  I've always been a big fan of (the idea behind) RSS. I follow <strong>a lot</strong> of blogs and I do get tired of browsing to all of them individually.</p>

<p>At least a dozen times I've gathered a list of all of my favorite blogs, added them to an RSS reader and then realized that there isn't a single RSS that doesn't annoy the crap out of me to use*.</p>

<p>*Let me take that back. The RSS reader built in to the Opera browser is as close to perfect as I can imagine. Unfortunately there are a <a title="Decision Time – Picking A Web Browser" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/decision-time-picking-the-best-web-browser/">slew of other reasons</a> I can't use that browser regularly.</p>

<p>Then came Twitter. All of my favorite blogs have Twitter accounts, and following them not only keeps me up-to-date on their posts, but I get to see what they're reading and working on. This has become my only real use for Twitter as a reader. I follow all of my favorite publishers so I can stay up to date with all of the great content they put out.</p>

<h2>Twitter For Publishers</h2>

<p>In early 2011, I started blogging.</p>

<p>Becoming a publisher gave me an entirely different perspective on using Twitter.  Twitter for publishers suddenly becomes all about gaining followers and increasing your CTR ( Click Through Rate ) on links you share. Looking back now, I think I took three wrong approaches when getting started as a publisher:</p>

<ol>
<li>I misrepresented myself.</li>
<li>I acted like a business, not a person.</li>
<li>I lumped my Tweets together, other times going days with no activity.</li>
</ol>


<p>Where I think I went wrong was misrepresenting myself to my Twitter followers. I tried to be someone I wasn't, which gained me a decent number of followers. However, when I would let my real personality shine through; I'd lose those followers and have to start over again.</p>

<p>Recently, I <a title="Why You Should Retweet" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/why-retweet/">wrote a post</a> about being yourself on Twitter and I've tried to stick to it over the last few months. It's been a slow growth, but every week ends with me having more followers than the last. I think some of the best things you can do as a Twitter publisher are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always Be Yourself</li>
<li>Be Transparent ( If you're desperate for clicks and re-tweets, ask for them! )</li>
<li>Be patient. Just like a website, a new Twitter account will take a while to pick up steam.</li>
<li>Learn from the best. Look at the most popular Twitterers in your field. More than likely they are funny, honest, intelligent and provide <strong>value </strong>to their followers.</li>
</ul>
