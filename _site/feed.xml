				<title>Lessons Learned From Startup Weekend</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend I attended my first &lt;a href=&quot;http://annarbor.startupweekend.org/&quot;&gt;Startup Weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/startup_weekend.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The event went from Friday at 6pm until the following Sunday at 3:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days were broken down like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Friday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gather for orientation at 6pm. We checked in and had pizza and drinks in a big meeting room. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/dtrenz&quot;&gt;@dtrenz&lt;/a&gt; and some other friends from my Meetup group were there and it was fun to catch up while we ate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we were all done eating, we were brought into the large auditorium for the 'pitchfire' event. Before we got started -- the people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://rapt.fm/&quot;&gt;Rapt.FM&lt;/a&gt; showed us their new KickStarter video and gave a pretty inspiring presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their CEO, Erik Torenberg, gave a really inspiring speech about his experiences with Startup Weekend events. He talked about his first event, driving down to Chicago with some of his friends, and the mistakes they made. He told us that his pitch was well received and he ended up being in charge of his our Startup Group. He talked about how the group completely fell apart and jokingly (I hope) said his team didn't even get the free point from the judges for participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that the 'pitchfire' began. Anyone that wanted could get in line and give a 60 second pitch for their startup idea. I think all in all there were 54 pitches on Friday. The ideas largely consisted of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobile Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crowdsourcing / Crowdfunding Websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational Websites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the pitches were finished, each person who pitched got a piece of paper with their startups name on it and we moved back into the meeting room to vote on our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first thing I think should have been done differently. The people who pitched were awkwardly wandering around the room with their sheet of paper, trying to get votes ( sticky notes that every participant received three of ). There were a few problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was really hard to find a specific startup as they wandered around the room.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was hard to talk about your favorites with hopeful pitchers standing over your shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was pretty awkward when a good 70% of them got no votes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things got really awkward when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/aiwdesign&quot;&gt;@aiwdesign&lt;/a&gt; and I ended up some of the last people with all of our votes left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If I were in charge I would have had all the pitchers stand at the front of the room giving out more details of their startup. Then I would have had a nice web application that allowed for anonymous voting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the voting was done the group in charge picked the 10 most popular and the rest of the startup ideas were tossed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then came the second most awkward part of the evening. With the 10 groups remaining the rest of us had to decide which group to join.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone wanted mobile developers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/dtrenz&quot;&gt;@dtrenz&lt;/a&gt; was one of the few lucky enough to end up in a group with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Our First Big Mistake&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We overcommitted ourselves. We found a group that wanted to make a mobile application for the popular game Assassin. We (despite having no experience) volunteered to use PhoneGap to publish a native app that would help facilitate playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up in a group of 9, sitting upstairs talking about the game and how much more fun it would be if we could add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic target assignment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GPS tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-app purchases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Our Second Big Mistake&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We didn't understand our Minimum Viable Product. We got it into our heads that the MVP was a functioning mobile application. The &lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; MVP was a great presentation and perhaps a bit of a tech demo. Unfortunately it took us until Sunday morning to realize this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Saturday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, Saturday was a pretty stressful day for our group. Things kept going wrong and I think we all started to feel the stress of a failing project. We met with a few really cool mentors but overall spent our time poorly and didn't get as much as we should have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a few things I would have done differently are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split off from the non-developers. They had a lot of great ideas but ultimately were very distracting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divied the work up better. Too much time was spent waiting on someone else to finish something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kept it cool. I tend to get anxious when things aren't going well. The other two devs I was working with did a much better job keeping it together than I did. Thanks you guys!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We had an OK day and I left wishing I can gotten more accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the day we really pulled it together. I think we realized how little time we had left before presenting and for the first time really got down to what it was we needed to present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelly really stepped it up and made some great looking screenshots for us. Ian did a great job and put together a demo of our game. The rest of our team really pulled it together with some great slides and a killer presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In minutes I watched our group turn from failed mobile app to excited entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our group leader -- Chening -- got up on stage and just knocked it out of the park with a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We nailed second place.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My Git Cheat Sheet</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this isn't too confusing to everyone. I've been learning a lot about git lately and have decided to use this post as a dumping ground for all the cool git tricks I pick up along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to add a trick or have a better way? Just leave it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To Add all 'modified' files and commit at the same time.&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git commit -a -m 'Commit message'
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;To Undo a commit and put committed files back in staging&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git reset --soft HEAD^
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;To unstage a file&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git reset HEAD filename
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;Blow away all changes since last commit&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git checkout -- filename
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;To add a file ( or files ) to the last commit&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git add filename
git commit --amend -m 'new commit message'
&lt;/pre&gt;




&lt;h2&gt;Blow away the last commit entirely&lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;pre&gt;
git reset --hard HEAD^
&lt;/pre&gt;

				<title>Choosing A Text Editor</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img csrc=&quot;/images/choosing-a-text-editor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;It Doesn't Matter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bet you weren't expecting that, but it's really the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As programmers, we use text editors to write code. A good text editor will help you do that more powerfully and efficiently. The thing is, 90% of text editors on the market today do both of those things magnificently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really matters it that you identify the features you need in a modern text editor and then choose any of the dozens of editors that offer those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Must Have Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File Browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic Indentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line Numbering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find and Replace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun Plugins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is what I've come up with so far as my must-haves. 'Fun Plugins' is a bit vague but I just mean your editor should have a good developer community adding great features and keeping up with new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think you should try as many editors as possible until you find one that just clicks with you. Also, I think trying a lot of editors is good because you never know when you're going to find yourself in a situation that requires the use of a particular editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think you should try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emacs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Netbeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gedit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TextMate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Try Them All&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find it quite enjoyable to play around with multiple editors. They each offer something unique and I think you'll find yourself with multiple favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any other editor suggestions? Leave 'em in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Wrapping Up 2012</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It's been a crazy year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know January is a bit late for an end of the year wrap-up but the end of the year came and went so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;/2011-review-a-thank-you/&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; wrapping up the first year of this blog and highlighting some goals for 2012. Looking back on my goals I'm surprised both at how few I achieved as well as how much my priorities have shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goals For 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals for this past year were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an e-book and give it away to my readers. Preferably something on Search Engine Optimization or Online Marketing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write guest posts for at least 5 blogs more popular than mine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make friends with other starting bloggers, it gets lonely sometimes :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write at least 100 articles. ( Twice as many as this year )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start posting video screencasts as an alternative way to deliver information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publish an Ebook&lt;/strong&gt; - This has fallen completely off my radar. I like the idea of publishing work longer than a blog post but I'm not so interested in SEO and Internet Marketing right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest Posts&lt;/strong&gt; - This still interests me, but I wrote a whopping 0 guest posts last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Friends&lt;/strong&gt; - This has proven quite successful! I've become involved ( now teaching ) at my local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/&quot;&gt;PHP Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write 100 Posts&lt;/strong&gt; - I didn't even make sixty. Still, more than last year...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with Screencasts&lt;/strong&gt; - Still on the to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty depressing at first glance, but I've accomplished quite a bit in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accomplishments In 2012&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all this has been a pretty incredible year. In January I started a paid internship with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wojodesign.com/&quot;&gt;great web design firm&lt;/a&gt; which helped push my skills to the next level. Working for Wojo Design really helped my figure out what I want to do for my career ( despite it being different from what I was doing for them ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;PHP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really thought that front-end design and WordPress were the tools for me. Then, this year, I started to develop PHP applications pretty heavily and fell in love. Back-end development has become my obsession. I've built Social Networks, Photo Sharing Applications, Blog's, Content Management Systems and I'm just getting started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Technologies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently migrated both my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jonkuperman.com/&quot;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; as well as my company blog from WordPress to &lt;a href=&quot;/getting-started-with-jekyll/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. It's been a really fun project and the results are amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;PHP Meetup Group&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/&quot;&gt;PHP Meetup Group&lt;/a&gt; has gained a lot of traction this year. It has become one of the things I most look forward to and I hope it keeps going at its current pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Job&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a strange twist of fate, I landed ( my first ) full-time job at the end of this year. I've started working for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medhub.com/&quot;&gt;Medical Software&lt;/a&gt; company and so far it's pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goals For 2013&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try and outline a few general goals for the upcoming year. As long as I learn a lot in my field and have a ton of fun I'll be satisfied but having a written list of goals seems like the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, Git, and CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teach More.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actually start making screencasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who reads and leaves comments on this blog. It's really become a huge part of my life and I can't tell you how much readership and feedback means to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, the ubiquitous end of the year post is over. Thanks for bearing with me!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Getting Started With Jekyll</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been really interested in checking out &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to their website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That didn't clear things up for me either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, Jekyll is a great little ruby program that allows you to make a blog with all the bells and whistles you're used to, and then export the entire thing into fast, secure, cachable HTML files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the actual Jekyll install a bit confusing. So I started with this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base&quot;&gt;Jekyll Base&lt;/a&gt; project that Daniel McGraw has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see something like this after you download it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre rel=&quot;File Structure&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    | _layouts
    | _posts
    | README.md
    | _config.yml
    | index.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that's it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download that project from github and stash it in a folder. Next we need to install Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire up that terminal ( I know it can be scary but this is pretty painless! )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    sudo gem install jekyll
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Assuming you already have ruby installed that should take care of that. Otherwise you might have to install ruby manually but that's not for this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step, and this is totally optional is to install RDiscount so we can use Markdown to make blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    sudo gem install rdiscount
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We're good to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's move to that folder where you put Daniel's Jekyll Base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop open your terminal and change directory to that folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    cd ~/path/to/that/folder
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    jekyll --server
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order for Jekyll to update files as you edit, the terminal running jekyll --server either needs to be left on or turned on after each change and before you expect to see anything in the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then open up your favorite browser and navigation to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and there you have it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look back in your file directory, you'll see that Jekyll added some more files and folders. For more information on what those are and why they're important, check out Daniel's post &lt;a href=&quot;http://danielmcgraw.com/2011/04/18/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-With-Jekyll-Part-2/&quot;&gt;on his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;. We're just going to jump right in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Writing Your First Post&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open up your favorite text editor and use it to open _posts/1985-10-26-Test-Post.md. You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre rel=&quot;Markdown&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
---
layout: post
title: Test Post
---

This is a test post writen in markdown. To learn more about markdown check out the 
[documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) on 
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/).
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Like the post says, if you want more information on Markdown, check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and get your hands dirty! Use that Daring Fireball post to figure out the syntax of Markdown. Feel free to just use regular HTML if you prefer although I think you'll find Markdown very elegant. If you want to change the 'date' of the post, just change the date in the filename. When you're ready to see your post, just head over to the browser and refresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to do a whole series on Jekyll deployment. For now, just know that you can take the entire contents of _site and stick them on the web via FTP. They should be all good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Common Pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that jekyll --server both compiles all your Jekyll code into HTML and is needed for local viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before trying anything tricky, check if there is already a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; for what you're attempting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make backups before trying to export your current blog format to Jekyll ( there are good tools but it can get messy ).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, if you're moving from a more robust platform like WordPress here are some things you'll need to figure out that Jekyll doesn't offer out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom 404 page ( use htaccess )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sitemap ( Jekyll plugin )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RSS Feed ( Jekyll plugin )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty Permalinks ( edit _config.yml )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Good Luck Out There&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know in the comments if any of this was unclear or just isn't working. I'm planning on doing &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; more posts on Jekyll so check back soon!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Passing Parameters in Javascript onClick Event</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into a problem today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was trying to generate a bunch of input buttons with JavaScript and have each of them do something unique onClick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Wrong Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre rel=&quot;JavaScript&quot; class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    var temp;
    var myArr = new Array();
    myArr[0] = &quot;Peter&quot;;
    myArr[1] = &quot;Paul&quot;;
    myArr[2] = &quot;Tony&quot;;
    myArr[3] = &quot;Adam&quot;;

    function display(name) {

        alert(name);

    }

    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 4; i ++)
    {
        temp = myArr[i];
        document.write('&amp;lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; onclick=&quot;display(temp)&quot; value=&quot;Display&quot;&gt;');
    }
&amp;lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is in JavaScript global variable. Since temp is a global variable, the onclick trigger sends the content of temp after the loop is all finished. Since Adam is the last value to be stored in temp, that's what all buttons alert. The trick is to use input name as a non-global and then pass the whole input tag to the function like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Right Way&lt;/h2&gt;

				<title>Mashable Gets A Great New Look</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven't seen it already, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.mashable.com/&quot;&gt;Mashable's Beta site&lt;/a&gt; and check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-2598&quot; title=&quot;mashable&quot; src=&quot;/images/mashable.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Acceptance At First Sight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try as I might, I'm always against big design changes initially. Over the years I've learned to keep my feelings to myself for at least two weeks. Typically after a few days I find myself really enjoying a new design but initially I almost always find them off putting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time was different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this design. It really makes the most of my screen real estate and yet I have an easy time reading through the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Get Out Of My Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I really enjoy in a &lt;em&gt;news site &lt;/em&gt;design is when they just get out of your way and give you the news. The logo is minimal, a nice fixed bar at the top has all the navigation you need; Other than that, you can just get down to business reading articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go check it out and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>On CSS Frameworks</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, CSS Frameworks have started to dominate the web. They are particularly useful, especially for start-ups that need a site built fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Are CSS Frameworks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A CSS Framework is a stylesheet you can use to rapidly prototype your website. Essentially, they give you a bunch of classes and ID's you can use that make your website look sweet. The two most popular CSS Frameworks on the market right now are &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://foundation.zurb.com/&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Which One Is Better&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2590&quot; title=&quot;cssframeworks&quot; src=&quot;/images/cssframeworks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;tl;dr I like Foundation better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks over at Design Shack did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://designshack.net/articles/css/framework-fight-zurb-foundation-vs-twitter-bootstrap/&quot;&gt;pretty nice comparison&lt;/a&gt; that I agree with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both nice looking, responsive and come with all the styles you should need for your project. I happen to like the buttons and typography that Foundation provides a bit better and I'm getting a little tired of seeing Bootstrap everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally I try hard not to hate things just because they are popular, but seeing the same buttons / forms / typography on dozens of websites each day gets me a little tired of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some Good Must Come Of This&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I (think) I heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://chriscoyier.net/&quot;&gt;Chris Coyier&lt;/a&gt; talking about the potentials pros of having Twitter Bootstrap all over the place. He mentioned the usability gains for users that see the same CSS elements all over the place. I see some merit to that. I think users might enjoy seeing similar buttons and forms on many of the services they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cast Your Vote!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you all think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they good? bad? Which one is your favorite? Share in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Things I'm Excited About</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I wasn't quite sure if this merited a full blog post but I think it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of things that have me excited, particularly pertaining to web design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. FireFox Web Developer Toolbar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When FireFox released their own Inspect Element &lt;a title=&quot;Nobody EVER Wants Firefox’s Inspect Element&quot; href=&quot;http://www.insitedesignlab.com/nobody-ever-wants-firefoxs-inspect-element/&quot;&gt;I was pretty disappointed&lt;/a&gt;. It was a cool idea but it's nowhere near as useful as Firebug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I updated FireFox and saw their brand new developer toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2570&quot; title=&quot;firefox_developer_toolbar&quot; src=&quot;/images/firefox_developer_toolbar.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think they really nailed it with this one. It's elegant, useful, fun and stays out of your way. If you're a developer, go grab a FireFox update and check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Brackets.io&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a project that I honestly passed right over without a second thought. A few weeks later, I came back to their website and can't believe I didn't see the potential in the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team here is providing a fun and elegant solution for programming the web, in the web. Browser based editors make a ton of sense and this one looks really promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2572&quot; title=&quot;brackets&quot; src=&quot;/images/brackets.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;3. Application Programing Interfaces&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application Programming Interfaces or APIs are interfaces between two pieces of software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really what this means is that they are fun tools that allow you to get cool information from popular web services. For example, you can easily create a web page that lists all tweets that mention you, displays your last 10 Flickr images, shows your GitHub followers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many possibilities using APIs that there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://klout.com/&quot;&gt;entire companies&lt;/a&gt; that offer services just off of other services APIs&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Timely is Going Paid - I'm Going to Buffer</title>
				<description>&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2560&quot; title=&quot;timely&quot; src=&quot;/images/timely.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What is Timely&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timely.is&quot;&gt;Timely&lt;/a&gt;, at its simplest form, is a tweet scheduler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of posting your tweets directly to Twitter, you can (after signing up) start scheduling them on Timely. After you've posted a few tweet via Timely's interface, their software will start analyzing the impact of each tweet in hopes of finding the most ideal times during the day to reach your followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timely, and services like it are really great for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're like me and do a lot of your article reading / sharing at one point during the day, Timely is a great way to spread them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timely allows you to see some data about your tweets. How many people saw it, favorited it, re-tweeted it. Tools like that help you better understand your followers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timely's main goal seems to work. It was able to find times throughout the day that seemed to get me a better impact on my tweets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Going Paid All Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been a big fan of Timely for the past year. The service seems to go down pretty often, but being a free service I've had no real complaints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first got the email about their service going premium, I was hoping for one of three things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would be grandfathered in as a free user, since I've been using the software for so long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would have to start paying, but it would be a reasonable rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would have to pay an unreasonable rate, but since the software was now premium, there would be some great new tools to explore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, none of these things happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Timely Is Worth To Me&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don't make any money with my Twitter account. I understand that many people using such software probably make money from tweeting, at least indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't make any money from my blog, and I only use Twitter to promote my blog - so I don't really have much to gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do, however, pay for some services for my blog. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://typekit.com/&quot;&gt;Typekit&lt;/a&gt; for sweet fonts, and I happily pay the $25 per year for their great service. Like Typekit, I'd happily pay approximately $25 per year to have my tweets nicely scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how much is Timely going to charge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$10 per month&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, $10 each month just to add some functionality to a great free service (Twitter)? I just can't justify that cost. Are they going to release any new, great features? It doesn't seem like it. What about some benefit for using their service for two years? Nada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goodbye Timely, Hello Buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a quick Google search, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://bufferapp.com/&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffer is freakin' awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does the same things Timely does - but Buffer supports Facebook, LinkedIn and app.net as well. It also comes with a better Dashboard, full analytics, browser plugins and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing around with the Dashboard a bit I was sold. I decided to get the Chrome plugin and check it out. Like Timely, it offers a quick button for posting the story you're reading to Twitter. Unlike Timely, it has all sorts of awesome suprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; - Check out this little gem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;img-wrap&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2565&quot; title=&quot;hacker_news&quot; src=&quot;/images/hacker_news.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I keep finding great little things like this. I really think Buffer offers a superior service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it's free!&lt;/p&gt;
