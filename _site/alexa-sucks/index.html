    <h2>Why Is My Alexa Rank So Low?</h2>

<p>As a member of the Web Design &amp; Search Engine Optimization industry, Alexa is one of my least favorite topics of discussion with clients. I pride myself on being a man who has the answers. I'm more than comfortable answering questions like:</p>

<blockquote>How can I get more traffic to my web site?</blockquote>




<blockquote>What can I do to improve my conversion rate?</blockquote>




<blockquote>Can you explain the different online advertising companies to me and tell me which one would be best for my business?</blockquote>


<p>But one of the few questions I just can't answer is, <em>why is my Alexa rank so low?</em></p>

<p>The best answer I can come up with is, because <strong>Alexa Sucks</strong>.</p>

<h3>Alexa Sucks, The Case Study</h3>

<p>I was recently hired by a Japanese toy store to run a social media campaign. Their store gets a good amount of traffic (<strong>3,500+ unique visitors per day</strong>) and their Alexa rank is terrible (<strong>1,042,039 at the time of this article</strong>). They were very concerned about their Alexa rank, apparently some of their potential investors wanted to justify the investment based on their rank alone.</p>

<p>I explained to them that at best <strong>Alexa provides a biased, incomplete, seemingly arbitrary review of most web sites, and that it's ridiculous that any professional would give any credibility to a web site's rank</strong>.</p>

<p>The conversation went over well and they decided to give up on the idea of improving their rank. That is, until we launched a small forum for their customers and with only 200 or less hits a day, the forum's Alexa rank skyrocketed to <strong>500,000</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's Review:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">**The Store, which gets 3,000+ unique hits per day**</p>




<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028" title="Alexa_sucks_GSAM" src="/images/Alexa_sucks_GSAM.jpg" alt="" /></div>




<p style="text-align: center;">**The recently launched forum, which gets less than 200 unique hits per day**</p>




<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029" title="Alexa_sucks_Gundam_forums" src="/images/Alexa_sucks_Gundam_forums.jpg" alt="" /></div>




<p style="text-align: left;">Granted, by necessity, Alexa is an imperfect service. However I think that it is inexcusably flawed and biased. Here is where Alexa is flawed beyond repair:</p>


<ol>
<li>Alexa gathers its data from people using the Alexa Toolbar. Who uses the Alexa toolbar? Web Developers, Administrators, Geeks like myself. This means that a website like mine with very little traffic can rank in the low 400,000's while an extremely popular toy store like Gundam Store and More ranks over 1,000,000.</li>
<li>Although the majority of bloggers are based out of the United States, many (perhaps unreliable) statistics project that over 60% of Alexa Toolbar users are based in China. Is your web site catering to people in China? Mine sure isn't.</li>
<li>No one uses the stupid toolbar. It doesn't come pre-installed on any major browser, and the majority of the internet-surfing public doesn't go out of their way to download addons. Especially one's they can't <em>use</em> for anything.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Why Does It Matter That Alexa Sucks?</h3>

<p>Here's the thing. As a company, Alexa is actually fairly innocent and doesn't deserve much of the contempt I have. The <strong>real</strong> problem comes from third party applications using a web site's Alexa rank as a reliable means to grade the web site. Companies like BuySellAds, WebsiteGrader, and (rumored) Google use the Alexa's ranking system in their own algorithms to determine popularity.</p>

<p>So, the real problem is that other, important companies take Alexa's ranking system as a reliable means to learn about a web site when it clearly is not.</p>

<h3>Your Thoughts</h3>

<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts if any of you have had experiences with Alexa's ranking system whether they've been good or bad. I'd like to update this post with a few more case studies and try to figure out if I've just had bad experiences or if there really is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
