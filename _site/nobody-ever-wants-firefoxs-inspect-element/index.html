    <h1 class="title">Nobody EVER Wants Firefox's Inspect Element</h1>
    <p>I mean it. Nobody, ever, wants to use Firefox's inspect element instead of firebug. Let me be clear:</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2532" title="nobody_wants_firefox_inspect_element" src="/images/nobody_wants_firefox_inspect_element.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>When Mozilla first announced the launch of their very own element inspector I thought they had just purchased Firebug and incorporated all of Firebug's awesomeness into the browser. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>Additionally, when I first saw all the cool 3D rendering you could do of websites using Firefox's cool new element inspector I thought that it was definitely the tool for me. Wrong again.</p>

<h2>The iphone 5</h2>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2535" title="iphone_5_wont_wash_clothes" src="/images/iphone_5_wont_wash_clothes.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>Take the iphone 5 for example. The new case, retina display and powerful a6 chip make it among the best phones in the world. But when I need my shirt washed or my jeans dried, it's just not the device for me.</p>

<h2>Form Over Function</h2>

<p>Firefox's inspect element looks great, but it is in no way suitable for the common tasks that Firebug helps developers with everyday. I wouldn't be so bothered by their new element inspector if it didn't completely replace Firebug's 'Inspect Element' tab when you right click. Firebug has been demoted below and now reads 'Inspect Element Using Firebug' which although clear, does me little good when I mistakenly click the inspect element tab above.</p>

<p>3D website are cool, but I have work to do.</p>

<h2>My Suggestion</h2>

<p>I think Firebug should be returned to its former spot and Firefox's tool should go below it with a title like 'Make this website 3D and poke around'</p>

<p>deal?</p>
