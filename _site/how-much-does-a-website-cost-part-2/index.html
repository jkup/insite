    <h1 class="title">How Much Does A Website Cost - Part 2</h1>
    <p>This will be part 2 of a 2-series post and will cover factors that can be used to determine how much your web design project should cost. If you missed "Part-1" You can find it here: <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/how-much-does-a-website-cost-part-1/">Part - 1 | Choosing a designer</a>. Part 1 deals with choosing a designer and highlights the differences between <strong>Freelancers</strong>, <strong>Web Design Companies</strong>, and <strong>Marketing Firms. </strong>This section deals with the actual costs of web design projects and what to expect based on your budget.</p>

<h2>How Much Do Websites Cost</h2>

<p>With a variety of factors altering costs of web design, it is difficult to nail-down specifics. For this reason, most web design websites don't even give you a hint as to what they charge for projects. Unfortunately, this makes it difficult to assess how much websites actually cost. Additionally, people that aren't in the 'field' often times don't really understand what things will raise the cost significantly. Before we get  too far into pricing schemes, let's first take a look at things that dramatically increase the price of your project:</p>

<ul>
<li>E-commerce / Shopping Cart (Often times, this will be considered a completely separate project and have a separate price tag)</li>
<li>Content Management System (These are great and at this point almost a necessity, however they make designing more difficult and tend to up the price)</li>
<li>Multiple Page Templates (If your site has one 'look' to it with different content on each page, it will cost much less than if you have a few different styles on your site)</li>
<li>Search Engine Optimization (This is an entirely separate field. Despite the fact that many web designers offer this service as well, it will cost you a good amount extra)</li>
<li>Original Artwork (Things like logo's, banners, and icons often times do not come with standard web design packages and will cost extra)</li>
</ul>


<p>Well, now that we've got that out of the way lets start talking about what you can expect to get for your budget.</p>

<h2>$0 - $500 Web Design</h2>

<p>Websites that cost less than five hundred dollars are typically only found through new / inexperienced designers. Sometimes you can get lucky and find talented web designers that are starting out and get yourself a a great site for this price range but typically projects in this range will not look like the websites your competitors have. Often times designers that offer prices this low will use free templates and merely customize them to contain your content and maybe color scheme.  Although this may be all you currently have to spend on a project, I would sincerely recommend saving a little extra and getting a site you'll appreciate more in the end.</p>

<h2>$500 - $1,000 Web Design</h2>

<p>This is perhaps the trickiest price range because it is seen as a high-end project for an inexperienced developer but a low-end project for someone with more experience. If you find a less experienced designer you'll probably get a good amount of hours out of them. However, if you can find a more experienced company to take your project, you'll probably be able to get a basic Content Management System (CMS)  configured with a free template. The main thing to note here is that for around $1,000 you can either can a decent design or decent functionality. If you pay a designer the page will look much nicer but the usability will suffer. On the other hand, if you go with a CMS with a default theme your site will most-likely look 'good enough' and you will have the opportunity to have a blog, edit pages, and enjoy any and all free plugins that may be available.</p>

<h2>$1,000 - $5,000 Web Design</h2>

<p>I realize this is a large range to talk about but I think that it's an appropriate one. The biggest reason is that I believe this is the best range for any <strong>small</strong> web design project. When you get into the multiple thousand dollar range for your budget, you have a lot of choices for your website that you don't have with a lower budget. One of the options you have at this level is commissioning multiple people /companies to work on your site separately. For example, you could spend $2,000 with a graphic design agency to create a logo and some original artwork and then spend up to $3,000 on having the website built using the art you've already paid for. Not matter what approach you take, you should be able to get a great site within this budget. Many web design firms will do a full-functioning CMS with a custom design for less than $5,000. Alternatively, you could sacrifice some of the design and include some type of e-commerce solution for this budget. I'm not saying you'll be able to get everything you want, but this is probably the best price range for a starter site. The website you get for this range should look good and be scalable if you'd like to expand in the future.</p>

<h2>$5,000 - $15,000 Web Design</h2>

<p>I consider this a great range for a <strong>medium</strong> web design project. You should easily be able to find a designer you really like to work on a project with this budget. E-commerce solutions should be available to you as should well qualified graphic designers. You should be able to talk about adding Search Engine Optimization (SEO) added to the project and be treated to a decent amount of meetings / conference calls between you and their team. This price range should ensure that you have multiple stages to your project, allowing you to view a few different approaches and approve the one you like best. Sites falling in this price range should also be set up to handle higher traffic volumes.</p>

<h2>$15,000 - $50,000 Web Design</h2>

<p>This budget is what to expect for <strong>large</strong> web design projects. As far as design and art, you will be able to find some of the greatest designers around and get a unique website that really stands out from most. Concerning functionality, you should be able to get a website that does anything and everything you'd like it to. These projects often come with SEO, Analytics tools, great original artwork, and a general 'wow' feeling from all who view your website. Additionally, companies that handle projects of this size often have a large collective of employees who specialize in every aspect of the field. This means that if you want an e-commerce site you'll be dealing with someone who does exclusively e-commerce work. If you're using a CMS, you'll be able to get custom plugins written for you and maintaining the website after creation should be very simple. As a final note you should also be able to integrate any existing systems you may already have with this website.</p>

<h2>$50,000 and above Web Design</h2>

<p>These prices are usually reserved for<strong> corporate</strong> sites. Often times, websites of this size land you exclusive time with the design team. As you get up into this range the sky is the limit. You will be able to have incredible original art, a great functional design, any e-commerce solution you'd like, custom CMS's that are designed for your company, Marketing assistance and a great deal of Search Engine optimization.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I can already see this post being contentious being that there are so many different web designers out there with different price ranges and services lists. Most web design companies (like most other companies) charge what they can for their work. You may very well find an extremely talented designer that will provide you with an e-commerce solution for under $1,000. Adversely you may find an experienced designer that charges $20,000 for a small static site. So many variables alter these costs, I'm just trying to give everyone a general idea of what these companies charge and what services you should be able to get with your budget.</p>
