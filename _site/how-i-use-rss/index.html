<h2>RSS For Bloggers</h2>

<p>As a blogger or publisher, you most likely are constantly tracking the number of RSS subscribers your blog has. Publishers tend to view RSS subscribers as a status symbol. The number of RSS subscribers you have should dictate how many people read your articles every time you publish a new one.</p>

<p>It's common to see popular blogs with large groups of subscribers advertise them prominently.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1805" title="rss_count_for_onextrapixel" src="/images/rss_count_for_onextrapixel.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>As with Twitter followers and Facebook fans; Once you build up enough of a following, you can leverage your impressive numbers into credibility to gain more and more followers.</p>

<p>All too often however, publishers fixate on the number of subscribers without considering the experience that these subscribers or potential subscribers may have.</p>

<h2>RSS For Subscribers</h2>

<p>For subscribers, RSS feeds take on a different personality. Most readers don't really care about how many other people have subscribed to your feed, they care about <strong>themselves.</strong></p>

<p>Now, I don't mean to make readers out to be terrible, selfish individuals. Only to express the fact that most people viewing a blog are sitting at home or work, relatively alone and are looking for some type of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">value</span>.</p>

<h3>Value - The Million Dollar Buzzword</h3>

<p>There are essentially two reasons people subscribe to a blog:</p>

<ol>
<li>They honestly want to stay up to date with everything you write</li>
<li>You are offering something they want in return for their subscription</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Case 1 - You Have Awesome Content And Don't Need To Bribe Your Readers</strong></p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="awesome_website_with_high_rss" src="/images/awesome_website_with_high_rss.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>If you have a lot of great content and people genuinely want to stay up to date with what you have to say. You can put your RSS link wherever you want -- People will subscribe.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2 - You Gotta Give 'Em Something</strong></p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1818" title="make_people_subscribe" src="/images/make_people_subscribe.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>Just for the record -- Vandelay Design is one of my favorite blogs on the internet. I'm not implying that they <strong>need</strong> to give bundles away in order to get subscribers. They just happen to be a prime example of providing real value to their subscribers.</p>

<h2>How To Get RSS Subscribers</h2>

<p>The  point of this article is that if you really want more RSS subscribers for your blog; You either have to regularly deliver great content and engage your visitors or give away something worthwhile.</p>

<p>Some things that tend to draw subscribers:</p>

<ul>
<li>An eBook related to your blog</li>
<li>Icon Packs</li>
<li>WordPress Themes</li>
<li>Exclusive Content</li>
<li>Deals &amp; Coupons</li>
</ul>
