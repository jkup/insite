<p>I Love <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<h2>What Is The Best Linux Distro</h2>

<p>This is one of the most over-asked questions on the internet today.</p>

<p>It usually merits some type of answer about how Linux distributions are very similar and <strong>you should pick the one that's best for you</strong>.</p>

<p>I think that's crap.</p>

<h3>If You Need To Ask...</h3>

<p>If you are on a message board or blog looking to get that question answered, you should go ahead and install Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I am a Linux addict. It's my personal opinion that if Linux is meant for you, you'll be an expert in no time no matter which distribution you decide to install first.</p>

<p>Ubuntu is the only distribution that's made for complete newbies. I mean people that have never heard of bash, aren't comfortable using a CLI, don't care about package managers or dependency issues.</p>

<p>I think we ( 'nix users ) all too often forget what it's like to be an actual first-timer. Ubuntu has a great website, easy GUI installer, tons of support forums and channels and the biggest user base. It comes with a ton of additional software but that will make Windows user's feel right at home. I love Ubuntu and I think it's an ideal distribution for most users.</p>

<h3>Short Sleeve Shorts Under Long Sleeve Shirts</h3>

<p>Programmers are elitists, that's just a fact. Here are some common arguments against Ubuntu refuted.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu Is Slow And Bloated</strong></p>

<p>Seriously? Buy a better computer.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu's Package Manager Automatically Grabs Dependencies</strong></p>

<p>Most people don't have time to waste reading every single dependency for Aisleriot Solitaire. Automate it, that's what computers are for.</p>

<p><strong>The Community sucks because blah blah</strong></p>

<p>The Ubuntu community is huge, not finding help on a particular site / forum / chat-room? Try another one.</p>

<p><strong>I'm Too Advanced And Need To Be In More Control</strong></p>

<p>Why are you searching for the best distribution? You should know your favorite. And why are you reading my blog?</p>

<h2>I Love Ubuntu</h2>

<p>I'm not saying I'd use Ubuntu as my web server OS, but for beginner's / intermediates -- it's top dog.</p>
