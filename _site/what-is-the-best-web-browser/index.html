    <h2>What Makes A Web Browser Great</h2>

<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Warning</strong> - This article is subjective as all get out! If you're really looking for the best web browser, download a few of them and test them out. They perform similarly for the most part and you can feel free to choose any of them based on your personal preferences.</span></p>

<p>For this article, I've broken web browser qualities into 4 main categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Ease of Use</li>
<li>Things It Can't Do</li>
<li>Extensions &amp; Addons</li>
</ol>


<div class="img-wrap"><a style="margin: 15px;" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/internet_explorer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-791" title="internet_explorer" src="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/images/internet_explorer.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>


<p>Internet Explorer
Original Release - 1995</p>

<p>Current Version - 9</p>

<p>Download From - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home</a></p>

<h4>Final Rating - <strong><span style="color: #339966;">C</span></strong></h4>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<p><strong>Speed Rating - 8 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Internet Explorer's speed is really unremarkable. It's just fast enough to not notice, without being noticeably fast... still following me? If you decide to go with Internet Explorer, speed won't be one of your complaints.</p>

<p><strong>Ease Of Use - 6 out of 10</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #000 !important;">Internet Explorer used to be, in my opinion, the easiest browser to use. With the update to IE 9 they seem to have thrown a lot of that usability out the window. If you want to change anything, there is a tiny little cog in the top right of the browser. Click it and good luck finding what you're looking for.</p>


<p><strong>Things It Can't Do - 4 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Ok, here is where Internet Explorer really breaks down under pressure. Without getting too technical, Internet Explorer's CSS Support is just terrible. Thankfully it's gotten better by leaps and bounds since the release of IE 9 but it's just dreadful. If you are using a version of IE earlier than 9, you are just not going to experience websites as they are meant to be experienced. Plain and simple.</p>

<p><strong>Extensions &amp; Addons - 4 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Thankfully, with Internet Explorer 9 there actually <strong>are</strong> addons for IE. That being said, they are terrible and if you are the kind of person who likes the added functionality of extensions, you should really switch to a different browser.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/firefox.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-826" title="firefox" src="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/images/firefox.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>


<p>Mozilla Firefox
Original Release - 2004</p>

<p>Current Version - 6.0.1</p>

<p>Download From - <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a></p>

<h4>Final Rating - <span style="color: #339966;">A</span></h4>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<p><strong>Speed Rating - 7 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps my only complaint with Firefox is the speed. It is an incredible, robust browser but compared to others like Chrome and Opera it's a bit sluggish.</p>

<p><strong>Ease Of Use - 9 out of 10</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #000 !important;">Mozilla Firefox is a real joy to use. I'm loving the new interface they rolled out with version 5. They provide you with a lot of options for customizing your browsing experience and the controls are fairly intuitive.</p>


<p><strong>Things It Can't Do - 10 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Find me something Firefox can't do. Seriously, find one thing.</p>

<p><strong>Extensions &amp; Addons - 8 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Until recently, I think Firefox had the absolute best addons library available. Unfortunately, with stable releases coming faster than extensions developers can keep up with. Finding extensions that work with your version can prove to be a bit difficult.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/chrome.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-832" title="chrome" src="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/images/chrome.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>


<p>Google Chrome
Original Release - 2008</p>

<p>Current Version - 13</p>

<p>Download From - <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a></p>

<h4>Final Rating - <span style="color: #339966;">B</span></h4>

<div style="clear: both;"></div>


<p><strong>Speed Rating - 11 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Oh. My. God. Yes folks, that's right, Google's Chrome browser get's an 11 out of 10 rating for speed. It downloads in seconds and loads like you won't believe. Seriously, give it a whirl.</p>

<p><strong>Ease Of Use - 9 out of 10</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #000 !important;">Chrome is definitely the easiest to use of all of the browsers. Unfortunately, this is because it has the least amount of options.</p>


<p><strong>Things It Can't Do - 2 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, this is a big bone of contention for me. I fully understand that Chrome is meant to be lightning fast and easy to use, but it can't do certain web applications like printing Paypal labels. Also, if I see that "Aw, snap. We can't find the page you are looking for" more than 10 times a day, it stops being cute and starts making me mad.</p>

<p><strong>Extensions &amp; Addons - 9 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Before Firefox got their extension area all screwed up they were my favorite. Chrome has consistently offered an easy to use extensions section. With the new frustrations brought by Firefox, Chrome has replaced it in my heart and is now one of my favorite browsers as far as addons go.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/safari.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-842" title="safari" src="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/images/safari.jpg" alt="" /></a></div>


<p>Apple Safari
Original Release - 2003</p>

<p>Current Version - 5.1</p>

<p>Download From - <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">http://www.apple.com/safari/download/</a></p>

<h4>Final Rating - <span style="color: #339966;">B</span></h4>

<p><strong>Speed Rating - 8 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Safari's speed is right up between Firefox and Chrome. It's a fairly robust browser which slows down the loading time, but it's not so bloated that you'll be sitting there waiting for Google to load.</p>

<p><strong>Ease Of Use - 6 out of 10</strong></p>

<p style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #000 !important;">OK, I'll admit it. I really don't spend a lot of time on Safari. The ease of use **may** be a lot better than I'm giving credit for. But it has that unmistakable *Mac* feel that sends me running for this hills.</p>


<p><strong>Things It Can't Do - 9 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Seriously though, even with my little experience with the browser. Safari is awesome! It really packs quite the punch and I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Extensions &amp; Addons - 10 out of 10</strong></p>

<p>Wow oh wow. Only Apple can make pages this sweet. It is truly a joy to go <em>shopping</em> for extensions at on Apple's website. Trust me, it's awesome.</p>
