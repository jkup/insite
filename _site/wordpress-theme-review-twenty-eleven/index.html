    <h1 class="title">WordPress Theme Review: Twenty Eleven</h1>
    <div class="img-wrap"><img title="twentyeleven" src="/images/twentyeleven.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>Alright, before we get too far into this review. I should let you all know that I rarely, if ever, spend a significant amount of time checking out the default WordPress themes. Most of the work I do involves creating custom themes. Therefore I typically build the theme on my computer, install WordPress on a new host and immediately overwrite the existing theme.</p>

<p>The other day, my <a href="http://www.haileygray.com">girlfriend </a> who also is a WordPress theme developer wanted a personal blog. Wanting to start blogging before spending the hours developing a new theme, she just installed WordPress with the default theme and got to work writing. Let me just say right now, if you're just looking for a brief review of WordPress' new <strong>Twenty Eleven</strong> theme. It is <strong>Amazing!</strong> ****</p>

<h4>It's seriously fantastic.</h4>

<h3>Seriously, go use it. It's awesome.</h3>

<h2>Twenty Eleven's Greatest Features</h2>

<p>Not all of these features are exclusive to Twenty Eleven, a lot of them were also present in WordPress' Twenty Ten theme. However, this is a list of my favorite features that come with this theme:</p>

<ul>
<li>Looks great in every browser</li>
<li>Amazing fluid-width degrade. Twenty Eleven looks great no matter how wide your monitor is.</li>
<li>Drown Down Menus</li>
<li>Super Clean</li>
<li>Extremely easy to customize</li>
</ul>


<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-885" title="twenty-eleven-close-up" src="/images/twenty-eleven-close-up.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>As you can see, the Twenty Eleven theme is simple and easy to read. The images at the top are easy to swap out via the WordPress Dashboard and can be customized to display different images based on featured image or category.</p>

<p><strong>Warning! The image below is not my comment field. Just a picture of the Twenty Eleven Comments Field. Don't be fooled.</strong></p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895" title="twenty-eleven-comments" src="/images/twenty-eleven-comments.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>This is the out-of-the-box comment form for Twenty Eleven and I just love it. As you click inside the boxes, the tabs in the top left disappear. I've never seen this effect pulled off so well before.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you are just starting a new blog. I really recommend going with the default Twenty Eleven theme until you are ready to design / purchase a high-quality custom design. It can do everything needed to set you up with a successful blog. I really recommend giving it a try!</p>
