    <h1 class="title">Still So Much To Learn</h1>
    <p>Up late, browsing Hacker News it dawns on me how much I have left to learn. About the web, development and design.</p>

<h2>Nearly Two Years Ago...</h2>

<p>It's been almost two years since I landed my first web design internship. Knowing next-to-nothing about programming, the web or design - I was brought on board by a <a href="http://3.7designs.co/">web company in my area</a> where I got a good education in the fundamentals of Web Development and Search Engine Optimization.</p>

<p>After leaving the internship I <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/">started up my own company</a> doing freelance web design for clients on a budget. Right away I was having a blast and feeling on top of the world. I knew very little about the web but I was always able to hack projects together and figure out a <em>good **enough</em> solution. I was mostly installing pre-made themes with minor tweaks or creating website from Photoshop documents.</p>

<h2>Six Months In...</h2>

<p>After surviving this way for a while, I began to understand the technologies I was using and became fascinated with learning as much as possible about them. I purchased a <a href="http://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a> account and started watching hours and hours of training videos every day. I ran into that old adage "The more you learn, the less you know". As I began learning more about web servers, scripting languages, and web frameworks I couldn't believe how much there was out there. There is a serious difference between learning how to create WordPress themes and becoming a serious web developer.</p>

<h2>About A Year...</h2>

<p>I was a little over a year in the industry when I landed a paid internship at another <a href="http://wojodesign.com/">great web design company</a> helping out with SEO and design. They had a serious client base and I got to work on a large variety of projects. They introduced me to version control, as well as a more advanced view on design and development. Leaving this internship I has a much clearer sense of what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to be one of those developers with an incredible skill set and diverse portfolio. Since leaving I've begun taking my education a lot more seriously.</p>

<p>I re-enrolled in college and began taking a heavy load of computer science classes. I've expanded my blogroll to include dozens and dozens of design and development blogs. I've started reading aggregator websites like <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> daily and even become the co-organizer of a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/">local programming meetup group</a> in my hometown.</p>

<h2>Back To The Future</h2>

<p>As I continue learning, the list of items on my "to learn" list continues to grow. There are so many technologies I have a rudimentary knowledge of that I seek mastery for. I think the important thing to remember is that the journey is the destination. I need to keep it in my head that my to learn list will never reach zero, and that's part of what drew me to web development in the first place. New technologies are advancing at a pace that makes it extremely difficult to keep up, but the infrastructure of the industry is still built on concepts that have been around since the late 1970's.</p>

<p>So here's to never stopping learning, and always being aware of what we don't know.</p>
