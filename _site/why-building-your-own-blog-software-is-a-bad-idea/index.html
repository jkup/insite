    <h1 class="title">Why Building Your Own Blog Software is a Bad Idea</h1>
    <p>Four weeks and a thousand lines of code later, I've come to the conclusion that building custom blog software is just a bad idea.</p>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2420" title="php_frameworks" src="/images/php_frameworks.jpeg" alt="" /></div>


<h2>Developing a Blog</h2>

<p>I recently started developing web applications for myself using PHP and a variety of great frameworks. This is what lead me to believe creating my own blog was a good idea.</p>

<p>I've been using WordPress to blog since forever, and although I think it's the best CMS currently in existence, there were just a few things I always wanted done differently and I thought I was up to the challenge.</p>

<h2>My Blog Idea</h2>

<p>Lately I've become intrigued, maybe obsessed, with website performance. I really wanted to build a blog that was lighting fast. This meant a few goals for my project:</p>

<ul>
<li>As few HTTP requests as possible</li>
<li>Keep my MySQL queries down to a minimum</li>
<li>Use as few images as possible</li>
<li>Really tighten security, as I'm the only person using this software</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Foundation</h2>

<p>After a lot of consideration, I picked <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">Codeigniter</a>Â as my framework for the project and got to work. I build the basics in a night and was feeling pretty good about everything. I had a great login system, the ability to create and edit posts and it was lighting fast!</p>

<h2>Issues, issues and more issues</h2>

<p>It was at this point that I discovered a new appreciation for WordPress. I ran into a few problems I just couldn't solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pretty Permalinks - I really need to work on my Regex skills. I just could not get this working properly</li>
<li>A good editor. I tried CKEditor and TinyMCE but neither of them even came close to WordPress' custom TinyMCE theme</li>
<li>RSS. I really took advantage of WordPress automatically publishing an RSS feed. Building this functionality myself was tough</li>
</ul>


<h2>Home Sweet Home</h2>

<p>At least for now, I'm back to WordPress with a new found appreciation. Any of you ever tried building your own CMS? Care to share your thoughts?</p>
