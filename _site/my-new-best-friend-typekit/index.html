<p>Typekit is, in my opinion, the best way to get awesome fonts onto your website or blog.</p>

<p>Until today I've been using Google Fonts for all my sweet web fonts. Google Fonts are free and give you some pretty awesome fonts but getting Google fonts on your website makes your site slow. I was really suffering from a high bounce rate and my load time was hovering around 2 seconds.</p>

<p>After a variety of tests, I figured out that Google fonts were the main culprit for my slow load times so I began to look for alternatives. I found Typekit, and because of their unbelievable prices ( starting at $25 per year ) I bought a license. I found some really incredible fonts and switched them out with my Google fonts. Honestly, and I know this sounds ridiculous but my page load went from 2 seconds to around 800 milliseconds.</p>

<h2>The Reason For My Incredible Speed Boost</h2>

<p>Now, I'm not saying everyone will get the same speed boost that I got. I know I was pushing my limits with Google fonts. I had two different fonts each with two different versions which Google recommended against. However, I really do believe $25 per year is absolutely worth the incredible selection and vast speed improvements.</p>

<h2>Typekit vs. Google Fonts Usage</h2>

<p>One of the most interesting differences in switching to Typekit is the way you grab the fonts you want to change. With Google fonts, you pick the fonts you want to use, and the website gives you a link to an external stylesheet you put in the head of your website. Then,  just like regular fonts, you can use CSS to grab any element and give it a font-family of whatever font you picked.</p>

<p>With Typekit, and I'm not entirely sure why, you enter your web adress into their system. Then they give you two lines of JavaScript which you also stick in the head of your website. After that, you use the Typekit interface to grab onto HTML elements and within minutes it updates your website for you.</p>

<h2>My Conclusion</h2>

<p>Needless to say I'm a huge fan of Typekit and will be using it for all of my websites from now on. I really recommend you go check it out. With its reasonable price, amazing collection and blazing fast distribution you can't lose!</p>
