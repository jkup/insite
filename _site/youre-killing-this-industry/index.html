    <p>I love computer science.</p>

<p>I literally spend the majority of my waking hours developing software, reading about software development and learning how to get better at developing software.</p>

<h3>To me, software is freedom.</h3>

<p>Knowing how to develop software is the modern day equivalent of being a real-estate agent, construction worker, electrician, plumber, salesman and CEO. What other skill set allows you to start to finish craft any business of your dreams?</p>

<p>The days of brick and mortar are long gone, websites and mobile applications are the future and there seems to be no end to the money one can make with a little business sense and a strong development toolkit.</p>

<h2>How Can You Make That Boring</h2>

<p>Re-enrolling in college has been nothing short of an interesting experience. I've found a lot of my notions about <em>what college is like</em> held true and a surprising few have been completely shattered. Let's just skip ahead to the real point of this article.</p>

<p>Most of my classes are in the Computer Science department. Class after class is taught by older men with Phd's who seem to have lost all passion for the material they teach. They manage to make programming seem so boring people are literally walking out of my classes.</p>

<p>While we waste semester after semester building linked lists and terminal executing Java programs -- real people are having a blast out their creating e-commerce stores, social networks and Software as a Service.</p>

<h2>College is Not For Pan Flashes</h2>

<p>Now I know, College's can't be expected to change entire curriculums just because some hot new technology is being used on the web. I suppose my only point in all this is that it must take extreme apathy to make an industry like ours seem boring.</p>
