<h2>What is Timely</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.timely.is">Timely</a>, at its simplest form, is a tweet scheduler.</p>

<p>Instead of posting your tweets directly to Twitter, you can (after signing up) start scheduling them on Timely. After you've posted a few tweet via Timely's interface, their software will start analyzing the impact of each tweet in hopes of finding the most ideal times during the day to reach your followers.</p>

<p>Timely, and services like it are really great for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're like me and do a lot of your article reading / sharing at one point during the day, Timely is a great way to spread them out.</li>
<li>Timely allows you to see some data about your tweets. How many people saw it, favorited it, re-tweeted it. Tools like that help you better understand your followers.</li>
<li>Timely's main goal seems to work. It was able to find times throughout the day that seemed to get me a better impact on my tweets.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Going Paid All Wrong</h2>

<p>I've been a big fan of Timely for the past year. The service seems to go down pretty often, but being a free service I've had no real complaints.</p>

<p>When I first got the email about their service going premium, I was hoping for one of three things.</p>

<ol>
<li>I would be grandfathered in as a free user, since I've been using the software for so long.</li>
<li>I would have to start paying, but it would be a reasonable rate.</li>
<li>I would have to pay an unreasonable rate, but since the software was now premium, there would be some great new tools to explore.</li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, none of these things happened.</p>

<h2>What Timely Is Worth To Me</h2>

<p>Honestly, I don't make any money with my Twitter account. I understand that many people using such software probably make money from tweeting, at least indirectly.</p>

<p>I don't make any money from my blog, and I only use Twitter to promote my blog - so I don't really have much to gain.</p>

<p>I do, however, pay for some services for my blog. I use <a href="https://typekit.com/">Typekit</a> for sweet fonts, and I happily pay the $25 per year for their great service. Like Typekit, I'd happily pay approximately $25 per year to have my tweets nicely scheduled.</p>

<p>So, how much is Timely going to charge?</p>

<p><strong>$10 per month</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, $10 each month just to add some functionality to a great free service (Twitter)? I just can't justify that cost. Are they going to release any new, great features? It doesn't seem like it. What about some benefit for using their service for two years? Nada.</p>

<h2>Goodbye Timely, Hello Buffer</h2>

<p>After a quick Google search, I stumbled upon <a href="http://bufferapp.com/">Buffer</a>.</p>

<p>Buffer is freakin' awesome!</p>

<p>It does the same things Timely does - but Buffer supports Facebook, LinkedIn and app.net as well. It also comes with a better Dashboard, full analytics, browser plugins and more!</p>

<p>After playing around with the Dashboard a bit I was sold. I decided to get the Chrome plugin and check it out. Like Timely, it offers a quick button for posting the story you're reading to Twitter. Unlike Timely, it has all sorts of awesome suprises.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> - Check out this little gem!</p>

<p>I keep finding great little things like this. I really think Buffer offers a superior service.</p>

<p>And it's free!</p>
