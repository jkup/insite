    <h2>Not My Idea</h2>

<p>I'm a huge fan of giving credit where credit is due. This post is fully inspired by an <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">amazing post by Peter Norvig</a> that I read at the start of my programming career. It changed the way I thought about development in general and has really been a motivation throughout my career.</p>

<h2>The Idea</h2>

<p>Norvig's basic argument is that most books and training resources claim to be able to teach you development in 24 hours, 30 days, or 2 weeks. Norvig says:</p>

<blockquote>The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about computers, or that computers are somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else. There are no books on how to learn Beethoven, or Quantum Physics, or even Dog Grooming in a few days.</blockquote>


<p>A few days ago, someone emailed me looking to get started with Web Design, particularly WordPress. I decided to go ahead and turn my response into a blog post</p>

<h3>Step 1 - HTML and CSS</h3>

<p><strong>HTML</strong> ( Hyper Text Markup Language ) and <strong>CSS</strong> (Cascading Style Sheets ) are absolutely the fundamentals of any web design project. Even if you use a Content Management System like WordPress which automatically generates HTML, it's vital to be familiar with both of these languages.</p>

<p>HTML is just mark-up and is fairly easy to master. The HTML is the organization of content on a website. Using tags like &lt;body&gt; and &lt;head&gt; you will learn how to properly organize a website and its content. If you don't already know HTML, I recommend starting here: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a></p>

<p>CSS is where things start to get fun! Cascading Style Sheets ( the name is a bit deceptive ) is the language of layout and design. You will learn how to change text color, give elements backgrounds and move your website elements into a desired layout.</p>

<p>CSS gets really fun as you get advanced and you can start applying awesome effects like animations and transitions. I would recommend starting CSS here: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp</a></p>

<p>Once you have the basics of HTML and CSS down, here are a few websites I recommend checking out for more resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank">http://css-tricks.com/</a> - Great blog with beginner, intermediate and advanced CSS tutorials. Also has videos, free downloads, code snippets, etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://lea.verou.me/" target="_blank">http://lea.verou.me/</a> - Super rad lady that does really incredible stuff with just HTML and CSS</li>
<li><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/" target="_blank">http://net.tutsplus.com/</a> - Great free tutorial website. Has everything from basic HTML to advanced programming languages.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 2 - JavaScript and PHP</h3>

<p>After you get the basics of web design down, you could probably take what you know and start building WordPress sites fairly easily. However, if you want to get really good at this stuff, the two languages that get you there are JavaScript ( JS ) and PHP.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> A programming language that allows you to have interactivity with your users. Things like slideshows, animated websites, single page smooth scroll, etc. are all written in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Even though there are a number of great free resources out there for learning JavaScript. I really recommend getting a paid account at Lynda.com <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Member.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.lynda.<wbr>com/Member.aspx</wbr></a> .</p>

<p>The basic plan costs only $25.00 per month and it is very worth it to have the best in the field walking you through 10+ hour video courses on any language or technology. Lynda also offers courses in WordPress, PHP, CSS, HTML, and pretty much anything else you could think of.</p>

<p><strong>PHP:</strong> I recommend learning JavaScript first as it is easier and allows for more fun but PHP is really the foundation of any Content Management System like WordPress. With even a basic understanding of PHP, there will be nothing you can't do within WordPress. I also recommend Lynda.com for all of your PHP needs.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - The World is Yours</h3>

<p>At this point you should be a force to be reckoned with. I recommend picking your favorite thing and becoming an expert. There is plenty of stuff to learn about each topic and the world can always use more Javascript, CSS or PHP experts.</p>

<p>Try experimenting with different CMS' and Frameworks. Build PHP apps with <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a>  , check out <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Also be sure to not become snobby and check out new technologies like Ruby on Rails and Node.js!</p>
