<p>Once again inspired by <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>, I've decided to write a post to thank my readers and remind myself of how far this blog has come over the year.</p>

<h2>The Blog Begins</h2>

<p>This was an exciting year for this blog, mostly because it started this year! I started writing in April of 2011 and have written 53 posts to date.</p>

<p>Having a blog has always been a dream of mine. I love learning and I <strong>really</strong> love sharing my knowledge with others. I originally started <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this</span> blog as an SEO tactic to get people to <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/">my company website</a>. I was writing posts once a week and just trying to add enough original content to keep Google happy.</p>

<h2>My First Comment</h2>

<p>I still remember the first legitimate comment I got on this blog. It was from a super cool online marketer named <a href="http://jymtarrant.com/">Jym Tarrant</a>. Jym had read one of <a title="WordPress Plugins I love, but can’t find a use for" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/wordpress-plugins-i-love-but-cant-find-a-use-for/">my posts</a> and left me a nice comment afterwards. My perspective on blogging changed drastically that day.</p>

<p>Initially I was just writing for search engines because I heard it was a good thing to do. I never really considered my thoughts and opinions reaching a broad audience and the opportunities that come along with blogging. The idea of meeting awesome people in my field, having articles published and educating people on my favorite topics was almost too much for me to handle.</p>

<p>I was hooked.</p>

<h2>It's The Little Things</h2>

<p>Admittedly, I haven't had the success I would have liked to have by this point with my blog. I don't seem to be able to hang on to RSS subscribers and comments are still few and far between but I'm not discouraged. There have been a number of (relatively) small achievements that this blog has recieved that make it more than worthwhile. So far, articles on this blog have been:</p>

<ul>
<li>Used as part of a college curriculum</li>
<li>Linked to by a few well  known news websites</li>
<li>Been tweeted close to 100 times</li>
<li>Received well over 100 comments</li>
</ul>


<p>These have been really incredible accomplishments for me. They have given me the motivation to continue on and I'm really excited about this blog's future.</p>

<h2>My 2012 Resolutions</h2>

<p>During 2012, some things I would like to accomplish are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write an e-book and give it away to my readers. Preferably something on Search Engine Optimization or Online Marketing.</li>
<li>Write guest posts for at least 5 blogs more popular than mine.</li>
<li>Make friends with other starting bloggers, it gets lonely sometimes :)</li>
<li>Write at least 100 articles. ( Twice as many as this year )</li>
<li>Start posting video screencasts as an alternative way to deliver information.</li>
</ul>


<p>Well, those are my goals anyway. Let's see if I stick to them!</p>

<p>For those of you that do read my blog regularly, I sincerely thank you! If you are bloggers yourselves, drop me a line so I can check out your work.</p>

<p>Happy New Year to you all.</p>
