    <p>Every once and a while, I stumble on a topic of particular interest to me. The past week I've been reading a lot about distractions, particularly those coming from computers and smart phones and their effect on our ability to pay attention.</p>

<h2>Our Culture of Distraction</h2>

<p>While listening to a <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/031-with-matt-mullenweg/">great shoptalkshow</a> episode last week I stumbled upon a series of great articles and presentations on what I think is best summed up by <a href="http://ma.tt/2012/05/culture-of-distraction/">Matt Mullenweg</a> as our 'Culture of Distraction'.</p>

<p>Matt and Joe both speak to the rise of portable technology and social networking and their effect on our ability to pay attention. As Joe describes it, 'Attention is a muscle', and we as Americans are losing our ability to use that muscle.</p>

<h2>The Factors</h2>

<p>They talk about the advent of web-browsing smart phones causing a paradigm shift in how frequently we are online. With smart phones and increasingly portable computers we find ourselves browsing the web much more frequently than we did before. Being able to quickly get online at any time throughout the day has lead to a decrease in the amount of time we spend online per visit.</p>

<p>This paradigm shift, in tandem with the rise of social networking has led to literally thousands of wonderful distractions that leaves some suffering from information overload.</p>

<h2>Information Overload</h2>

<blockquote>**Information Overload** refers to the difficulty a person can have understanding an issue and making decisions that can be caused by the presence of too much information.</blockquote>


<p>It interests me that all of the ease and convenience given to us by smart phones, the internet, social networking and more are actually making it <strong>more difficult</strong> to get things done.</p>

<p>I'm just as guilty as anyone of living in a culture of distraction. Just as I'm writing this post I notice that I'm sitting here with multiple monitors, listening to music with my twitter window and an IRC terminal open next to me. Before reading all of this, I was quite sure that having such easy access to all of these blog posts, messages from friends and streaming media was actually helping my productivity as I <em>master the art of multi-tasking</em> but I'm beginning to question myself.</p>
