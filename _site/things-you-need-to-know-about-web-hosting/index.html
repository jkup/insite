<p>I've been a professional web developer for years now, and I've worked with just about every web host on the market. For the most part they're relatively similar, but there are some things you should know before purchasing web hosting.</p>

<h2>The Different Types Of Web Hosting</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Web Hosting - </strong>The most inexpensive plans. You pay for a shared spot on a web server.</li>
<li><strong>VPS Hosting - </strong>Moderately priced. You pay for a <em>Virtual Private Server</em>. Similar to a shared hosting plan except that you actually own a specific amount of hard drive space and memory.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated Hosting - </strong>Expensive. This option is only for extremely high traffic websites and you get what you pay for.</li>
</ul>


<p>For the sake of this article, we're going to be talking about <strong>Shared Hosting</strong> plans. I figure that anyone with the need for a <strong>VPS</strong> or <strong>Dedicated Server</strong> probably knows the in's and out's of web hosts.</p>

<h3>1. Domain Limits</h3>

<p>When you purchase a web hosting plan, the company you buy from is going to have its own set of rules regarding how many domains you're allowed to host and how much additional domains cost. A <strong>bad</strong> web host will put a limit on how many domains you can host, or charge monthly for each domain after the first. A <strong>good</strong> web host will offer you unlimited domains to host at no extra charge.</p>

<p>Now, hosting multiple domains <strong>might</strong> not be that important to you right now. But really think about it. If you're paying ( let's say ) $5.00 per month for your own web hosting plan and you get an idea for a new website. Do you really want to have to sign up for another $5.00 per month just to host your new domain? It's a really liberating feeling knowing that you can always add additional domains to your plan, so make sure you get yourself set up right from the beginning.</p>

<h3>2. MySQL Databases</h3>

<p>MySQL Databases are crucial for doing anything cool on the web. Without getting too technical, you can't have a forum, blog, CMS, wiki, etc without creating a MySQL database. While most web hosts offer a small number of databases, this is another area where you would rather be safe than sorry. A <strong>good</strong> web host will give you unlimited MySQL Databases so you can try out as many fun web applications as your heart desires!</p>

<h3>3. Customer Support</h3>

<p>Especially if you're new to owning your own website, you're going to run into problems and you're going to need to call customer support. Whether your website goes down, breaks, or isn't allowing you to do something you want to do; Customer support is really important. One thing to watch out for is web hosts that don't offer a phone number. Another handy trick is typing the name of your web host followed by words like <em>sucks, is terrible, is down into Google and seeing what blows back.</em></p>

<h2>My Recommendations:</h2>

<p>I'm not working for any hosting companies or collecting affiliate deals but I do have a few recommandations. The three best companies I've worked with are:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> - The best of both worlds - My top recommendation</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a> - The cheapest <em>great</em> host out there</li>
<li><a href="http://mediatemple.net/">Media Temple</a> - Top quality hosting for websites</li>
</ol>
