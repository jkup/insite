    <h3>Are You Looking For A List Of What Every Website Should Have?</h3>

<p>Well here we go. These are five things that should be found on every website.</p>

<h3>1. An Easy To Find Contact Form</h3>

<p>No matter what purpose your web site serves, it's always vital to have a nice looking contact form that can be easily found from any page. Having a potential client or customer contact you means you are half way to conversion. How much money do you think you're missing if people can't find an easy way to get a hold of you?</p>

<h3>2. Social Networking Icons</h3>

<p>Another great way to turn first time visitors into loyal customers. Most people are incredibly immersed in the social world, why not give them a way to keep in touch with you or your company. Social networking icons should be easily found on every page, as they not only provide your web site with free marketing, but they also provide your web site with <em>social proof.</em></p>

<h3>3. An About Page</h3>

<p>No one wants to follow a faceless company. Let your readers know more about you! Give your about page a personal touch, tell your readers who you are, where you're from, what you like and why you have this website. People like to see the human side of any business, making an about page a necessity for any web site.</p>

<h3>4. A Landing Page</h3>

<p>This is an absolute <strong>must</strong>Â for every web site. Landing pages are especially important if you are doing any sort of marketing. A landing page is a page on your web site that briefly explains your product or service, and offers some type of conversion form. Don't expect visitors to click through all of your links just to get to your contact page. Direct them to a page that has everything they need and encourages them to follow through with whatever your web site's next step is.</p>

<h3>5. A Readable Content Area</h3>

<p>Design is great. Art and Design can really help distinguish your web site from all of your competition. However, make sure that your content is easy to read. All too often I stumble on websites with a beautiful, artistic feel, but then I leave because reading their content strains my eyes. No matter what your sidebar or header look like, give your readers a break in the main area. Remember, <strong>Content is King</strong>.</p>
