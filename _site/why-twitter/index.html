    <h1 class="title">Why Twitter</h1>
    <p>With so many means of marketing your business, I'd like to talk about why Twitter deserves your attention.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>Twitter is an incredible marketing tool. Some of its biggest benefits are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Expand Your Reach</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Twitter allows you to connect with thousands of people. Giving you the chance to reach an audience that wouldn't be possible through local marketing efforts.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drive Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Link sharing is one of the fundamental uses of Twitter. It is a good practice to tweet links to your latest websites or blog posts. With an effective Twitter campaign, you can easily drive hundreds of visitors to your site.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make Connections</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>No matter what business you're in, you can be sure that the experts in that field can be found on Twitter. Follow them, message them, and make a connection.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learn</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>This gets overlooked too often, but Twitter is perhaps the best free ( indirect ) learning resource currently online. Following the right people and blogs on twitter provides you with endless updates pointing you towards free articles.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>All that being said, Twitter does have its share of downfalls.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Getting Started</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting your start with Twitter is certainly a difficult process. It's not intuitive, its usefulness is unclear and  everything you do is public.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Glitches &amp; Downtime</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm honestly not sure what the deal is here, perhaps it's just because Twitter is so popular but I constantly get error messages of the service being down and adding <em>Tweet</em> buttons to my websites has never worked 100% correctly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Spotlight</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm not sure if everyone experiences this, but personally I feel so much pressure before every non link share tweet I make. Who's following me? Is this annoying? offensive? pointless? In the end I just decided to stop thinking about it and just write whatever I feel like, it's done me well so far.</p>

<h2>The Point</h2>

<p>The point of this whole article is to show you why twitter is a must-have tool in your marketing arsenal. It's educational, and it can send tons of traffic your way. Plus, if you do it right it can be a lot of fun.</p>
