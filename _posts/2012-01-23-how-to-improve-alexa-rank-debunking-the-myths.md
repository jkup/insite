A few months ago, I <a title="Alexa Sucks and Here’s Why" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/alexa-sucks/">wrote an article</a> about how terribly inaccurate the Alexa page ranking service is.

Although my opinions on the matter haven't changed. I've seen a recent upswing in articles telling readers what tips and tricks they can use to boost their rankings. When it comes right down to it, there is only one trick that will legitimately work for improving your rank. First, let's debunk the rest of these myths.

## Things That Will Not Improve Alexa Rank

**1) Use Alexa Redirection Whenever You Can**

Not only is this myth completely false, but it's also completely dated. Way back in the day Alexa had a system that allowed this url structure:

http://redirect.alexa.com/redirect?yourwebsite.com

It was **believed** that if you gave people your Alex re-direct link as opposed to your normal link it would improve your ranking. I don't think this was ever true but it's a moot point now because the entire redirect.alexa.com sub-domain has ceased to be.

**2) Install Alexa Traffic Widgets On Your Website**

Before I tell you all about how this **is not** going to help your Alexa rank whatsoever, let us take a minute and relish on how absolutely ugly these widgets are.

You can find them here: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteowners/widgets">http://www.alexa.com/siteowners/widgets</a>

I absolutely, 100% guarantee you that placing one of these big, ugly, slow-to-load widgets on your website displaying your ( most likely ) very poor Alexa ranking will be a determent to your website.

Alexa has come right out and announced publicly that their traffic widgets **do not **increase rank. I say that even if they did, they aren't worth having on your website.

**3) Use Some 3rd Party / Non-Related SEO Service To Improve Rank**

While the simple concept of **Better Website = Better Rank** holds true in this scenario, don't fall for the bait. With thousands of people desperately looking to improve their Alexa rankings, low-down money-grubbing publishers haven taken the opportunity to try and sell you whatever affiliate software is currently paying them the most money. While investing in a legitimate SEO firm is almost always a good idea for a website, do your research first and don't expect some fly-by-night service to improve your Alexa rank.

## A Warning About Improving Alexa Rank

Before I get into the details of how to legitimately improve your Alexa rank, let's take a second and talk about whether or not it's really worth all the trouble.

Some important things to know:

+ Alexa does **not** affect your standing in the search engines
+ Alexa rank is well known as at least fairly inaccurate
+ A Higher Alexa rank won't guarantee more traffic to your website

### Why Most Theories Won't Improve Your Ranking

In order to understand why the aforementioned tips and tricks are useless it's important to understand the ideology behind the Alexa ranking system. Let's keep it simple with another bulleted list.

+ Alexa is trying to give every website an accurate grade
+ Alexa can only get its data from people using the Alexa toolbar
+ The only people using the Alexa toolbar are webmasters / tech enthusiasts, the people who know about an Alexa toolbar
+ For the above reason, technology blogs are skyrocketed to the tippy top of the Alexa ranking system
+ If your website doesn't have a ton of content ( like a blog ) and / or isn't technology related, you probably are **not** going to rank high. Ever.

Those are just the breaks when it comes to the Alexa ranking system, they're important to know.

## How To Improve Alexa Rank

After reading that list above you should have a pretty good idea of what you need to do.

1. Encourage your visitors to install the Alexa Toolbar
2. Publish content that Alexa Toolbar wielding visitors will seek out.

These are pretty much the same idea, split into two different approaches. Either convince your current readers to help you by installing that toolbar, or change up your content to attract a different type of visitor.

## Conclusion

Save your time and money.

If you are really concerned with the arbitrary ranking system, adapt.
