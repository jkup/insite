I mean, really, is your website set up for success?

Have you done all that you can to make your website pleasing to both the search engines and your users?

Are you really ready to just sit back and wait for the hits to start coming?

Ever asked yourself honestly, "How Good Is My Website?"

### Find Out How Good Your Site Is

Here are a few handy tools to let you know just how good your site is and what  its missing.

## 1. Website Grader By Hubspot

<a href="http://websitegrader.com/">http://websitegrader.com/</a>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1407" title="how-good-is-my-website-hubspot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/how-good-is-my-website-hubspot.jpg" alt="Hubspot's Website Grader" /></div>

This awesome website gives you a 1 - 100 grade based on a large number of variables. Then it walks you through its logic and shows you the areas you can improve on. This website is by far on of the best tools I've ever found on the internet, and it's totally free!

## 2. Google Analytics

<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"><span style="color: #99cc00;">http://www.google.com/analytics/</span></a>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1418" title="is-my-website-good-google-analytics" src="{{ site.url }}/images/is-my-website-good-google-analytics.jpg" alt="" /></div>

This is probably the most important tool for a webmaster. Not only is it a great free service that allows you to track **tons** of information about your visitors but it comes straight from Google and **what they say goes.** This awesome site allows you to track just about everything about your visitors from their location to their screen size.

## 3. Clicky Analytics

<a href="http://getclicky.com/"><span style="color: #99cc00;">http://getclicky.com</span></a>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1419" title="how-is-my-website-traffic-clicky-analytics" src="{{ site.url }}/images/how-is-my-website-traffic-clicky-analytics.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Let me just warn you that Clicky is a **serious addiction.** Similar to Google Analytics, Clicky tracks everyone who visits your website. Where they come from, how they got there and how long they stayed. However, unlike Google Analytics, Clicky tracks in real time; That means you can watch your traffic update minute to minute!

## 4. Google Webmaster

<a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/"><span style="color: #99cc00;">http://www.google.com/webmasters/</span></a>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1424" title="how-does-my-site-do-on-google-webmaster" src="{{ site.url }}/images/how-does-my-site-do-on-google-webmaster.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Google webmaster is an awesome tool. Instead of tracking your visitors, Webmaster shows you what your website looks like to Google. It will show you how Google percieves your sitemap, links, and **most importantly** it will show you what searches you show up for and what position you have for that search.

## 5. Yahoo Site Explorer

<a href="http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/"><span style="color: #99cc00;">http://siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com/</span></a>

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1425" title="how-many-sites-link-to-mine-yahoo" src="{{ site.url }}/images/how-many-sites-link-to-mine-yahoo.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Brought to you by Yahoo, this awesome tool shows you how many other websites are currently linking to your domain. This is a pretty great tool for a lot of reasons, and it's totally free!
