## It Doesn't Matter

Bet you weren't expecting that, but it's really the truth.

As programmers, we use text editors to write code. A good text editor will help you do that more powerfully and efficiently. The thing is, 90% of text editors on the market today do both of those things magnificently.

What really matters it that you identify the features you need in a modern text editor and then choose any of the dozens of editors that offer those features.

## Must Have Features


1. File Browser
2. Syntax Highlighting
3. Automatic Indentation
4. Line Numbering
5. Search
6. Find and Replace
7. Fun Plugins



This is what I've come up with so far as my must-haves. 'Fun Plugins' is a bit vague but I just mean your editor should have a good developer community adding great features and keeping up with new ones.

## My Suggestions

I think you should try as many editors as possible until you find one that just clicks with you. Also, I think trying a lot of editors is good because you never know when you're going to find yourself in a situation that requires the use of a particular editor.

That being said, I think you should try:


+ vim
+ emacs
+ Sublime Text 2
+ Netbeans
+ Gedit
+ TextMate



## Try Them All

I find it quite enjoyable to play around with multiple editors. They each offer something unique and I think you'll find yourself with multiple favorites.
