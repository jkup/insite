With so many means of marketing your business, I'd like to talk about why Twitter deserves your attention.
## The Good
Twitter is an incredible marketing tool. Some of its biggest benefits are:

+ **Expand Your Reach**

Twitter allows you to connect with thousands of people. Giving you the chance to reach an audience that wouldn't be possible through local marketing efforts.

+ **Drive Traffic**

Link sharing is one of the fundamental uses of Twitter. It is a good practice to tweet links to your latest websites or blog posts. With an effective Twitter campaign, you can easily drive hundreds of visitors to your site.

+ **Make Connections**

No matter what business you're in, you can be sure that the experts in that field can be found on Twitter. Follow them, message them, and make a connection.

+ **Learn**

This gets overlooked too often, but Twitter is perhaps the best free ( indirect ) learning resource currently online. Following the right people and blogs on twitter provides you with endless updates pointing you towards free articles.

## The Bad

All that being said, Twitter does have its share of downfalls.

+ **Getting Started**

Getting your start with Twitter is certainly a difficult process. It's not intuitive, its usefulness is unclear and  everything you do is public.

+ **Glitches &amp; Downtime**

I'm honestly not sure what the deal is here, perhaps it's just because Twitter is so popular but I constantly get error messages of the service being down and adding *Tweet* buttons to my websites has never worked 100% correctly.

+ **The Spotlight**

I'm not sure if everyone experiences this, but personally I feel so much pressure before every non link share tweet I make. Who's following me? Is this annoying? offensive? pointless? In the end I just decided to stop thinking about it and just write whatever I feel like, it's done me well so far.

## The Point

The point of this whole article is to show you why twitter is a must-have tool in your marketing arsenal. It's educational, and it can send tons of traffic your way. Plus, if you do it right it can be a lot of fun.
