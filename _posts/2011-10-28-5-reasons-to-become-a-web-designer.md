## 1) It's Creative

I've always been a fan of the arts. One problem I always had is I'm terrible at drawing / painting. Web Design is a great field that allows me to be artistic and expressive without having to pick up a pencil. Web design is a financially viable career that allows you do create and design and every company needs at least one.

## 2) It's A Much Needed Skill

These days every company / individual needs a website. I wager it's not long before everyone needs at least two websites. You'd have a pretty tough time finding someone that didn't at least sort of want a website commissioned.  Whether it be a personal blog, e-commerce store or business page. Web design is in extremely high demand.

## 3) It's Quickly Evolving

Web design and the languages associated with it are evolving at an awesome pace. With the recent introduction of HTML5 and CSS3 it's truly a great time to be in the industry. There are also many sub-fields forming in the industry. You can design websites for phones, or websites that provide great UX to increase conversions. There's too  much for one person to master and more comes out every day.

## 4) It's A Great Conversation Starter

Being a web designer means you'll always have something to talk about when you meet new people. This relates to #2, wherein <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everyone</span> needs a website. This means everyone you meet will want to at least figure out if you can help them with a web project they have in mind.

## 5) You Can Start Any Business You Want

This is probably my favorite reason of them all. Being able to make awesome, professional quality websites means you can take any business idea you have, and give it a successful public face. Having a top-end website already puts you ahead of the competition in most business fields. If you want to sell sell dog biscuits, go on and make the best looking dog biscuit store on the internet!
