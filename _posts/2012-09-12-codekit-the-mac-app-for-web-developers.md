For one reason or another, and despite being a software developer, I rarely spend money on software.

After numerous <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/111-get-yourself-preprocessing-in-just-a-few-minutes/">CSS-Tricks Screencasts</a>, I finally decided to purchase a license of <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>.

## What It Does

This app has so many features, they include...

1. It provides an easy and visual way for you to compile any pre-processed code like SASS or JADE.
2. It provides a brilliantly simple tool allowing you to losslessly compress your images.
3. It gives you live, animated browser reloads. Say goodbye to clicking refresh as you develop!
4. It allows you to easily combine and minify all of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
5. It integrates seamlessly with JSHint and JSLint for easy JS debugging.
6. And so much more!

I feel like a way better developer using it. Since I purchased a license I downloaded all of my images and ran them through Codekit's one-click optimization. I losslessly reduced my total image size by 18%!

Since then I've felt free to really start experimenting with SASS and JADE and easily compressing all my code.

## What It Costs

It retails for only $25! Plus it's on a sliding scale so you can pay anywhere from $20-$28.

If I had one recommendation for the whole app it would be to increase the scale, $20-$100 seems like a better option.

So go grab it already!
