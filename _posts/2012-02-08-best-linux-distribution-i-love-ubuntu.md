I Love <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.

## What Is The Best Linux Distro

This is one of the most over-asked questions on the internet today.

It usually merits some type of answer about how Linux distributions are very similar and **you should pick the one that's best for you**.

I think that's crap.

### If You Need To Ask...

If you are on a message board or blog looking to get that question answered, you should go ahead and install Ubuntu.

I am a Linux addict. It's my personal opinion that if Linux is meant for you, you'll be an expert in no time no matter which distribution you decide to install first.

Ubuntu is the only distribution that's made for complete newbies. I mean people that have never heard of bash, aren't comfortable using a CLI, don't care about package managers or dependency issues.

I think we ( 'nix users ) all too often forget what it's like to be an actual first-timer. Ubuntu has a great website, easy GUI installer, tons of support forums and channels and the biggest user base. It comes with a ton of additional software but that will make Windows user's feel right at home. I love Ubuntu and I think it's an ideal distribution for most users.

### Short Sleeve Shorts Under Long Sleeve Shirts

Programmers are elitists, that's just a fact. Here are some common arguments against Ubuntu refuted.

**Ubuntu Is Slow And Bloated**

Seriously? Buy a better computer.

**Ubuntu's Package Manager Automatically Grabs Dependencies**

Most people don't have time to waste reading every single dependency for Aisleriot Solitaire. Automate it, that's what computers are for.

**The Community sucks because blah blah**

The Ubuntu community is huge, not finding help on a particular site / forum / chat-room? Try another one.

**I'm Too Advanced And Need To Be In More Control**

Why are you searching for the best distribution? You should know your favorite. And why are you reading my blog?

## I Love Ubuntu

I'm not saying I'd use Ubuntu as my web server OS, but for beginner's / intermediates -- it's top dog.
