I've noticed a strange surge lately of spam comments that leave a back-link for Google, Bing or Yahoo. Those aren't the typical sites you see in your spam comments folder. In addition to the strangely legitamate websites these spammers are commenting for I've noticed a crazy surge in the number of spam comments this blog gets. Typically it gets around 100 per day and today is well over 400.

## Complimentary Comment Spam 

I suppose I should also point out that the comments left by this particular brand of spammer are kind and full of pleasentries. I've seen my fair share of:

<blockquote>Good Read. I was thinking of writing a post like this</blockquote>

comments in the past but these take it to another level. One even went as far as to say:

<blockquote>Posts like this brighten up my day. Thanks for taking the time...</blockquote>

which makes it only a little less satisfying to hit that 'Empty Spam' button and move on.

### A Little Research

I did a bit of poking around and found <a href="http://www.warriorforum.com/adsense-ppc-seo-discussion-forum/448800-bing-com-google-com-yahoo-com-spam-comments.html">this forum</a> thread claiming that these are just test comments that spammers leave to see if your blog auto approves:

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1847" title="google_facebook_bing_spam_comments" src="{{ site.url }}/images/google_facebook_bing_spam_comments.jpg" alt="" /></div>

but I still feel that if this were true so many people wouldn't have just noticed such a sudden rush of them. I'm really not sure either way but it does seem like a strange new trend.

Any thoughts?
