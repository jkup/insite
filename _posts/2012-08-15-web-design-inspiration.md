## In the Beginning

When I first started my career, I derived 100% of my inspiration from other websites. When beginning a design, I'd search around for 5 or 6 websites in a competitive area. I'd find my favorite things about each, and sloppily stick them all together to create something that, although decent looking, was without purpose.

My first job within the industry was an internship with a <a href="http://3.7designs.co">local web firm</a>. I distinctly remember talking to the owner once and being totally shocked when he told me he derived his inspiration from designer products in no way related to the web.

I really liked his philosophy but just wasn't a good enough designer to cross mediums in such a way.

## A Few Years Later

As my career has progressed, I find myself getting inspired from minutiae of other websites. I recognize this to be a sign that I still have a long way to go in my career as a designer but I think it's a step in the right direction.

Often times I'll see a color swatch, a great font combination or a well functioning layout and a full website design will come from it. I think at this point I've simply built enough websites to fill in details after laying some ground work.

## Looking Towards the Future

In the coming years, I'd like to get to the point where my design inspiration comes from others forms of media besides the web. I'd like to create designs inspired from beautiful landscapes, creative packaging and really work on finding a style that is my own.

Where do you find your inspiration for the web? Did you follow a path similar to mine or have you had different experiences? I'd love it if you left some of your thoughts in the comments section below!
