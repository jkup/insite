## Acceptance At First Sight

Try as I might, I'm always against big design changes initially. Over the years I've learned to keep my feelings to myself for at least two weeks. Typically after a few days I find myself really enjoying a new design but initially I almost always find them off putting.

This time was different.

I really like this design. It really makes the most of my screen real estate and yet I have an easy time reading through the content.

## Get Out Of My Way

One thing I really enjoy in a *news site *design is when they just get out of your way and give you the news. The logo is minimal, a nice fixed bar at the top has all the navigation you need; Other than that, you can just get down to business reading articles.

Go check it out and let me know what you think!
