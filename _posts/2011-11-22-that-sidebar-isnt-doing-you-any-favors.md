## Your Blog's Sidebar Is Crippling Your Search Rankings

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="size-full wp-image-1496 aligncenter" title="growing_graph" src="{{ site.url }}/images/growing_graph.jpg" alt="" /></div>

### It all comes down to a simple SEO principle

<blockquote>Keywords are most important in your headers, starting with h1's and degrading accordingly.</blockquote>

This is a commonly accepted SEO principle. Web designers often put the most important key phrase inside an h1 tag and other crucial information inside h2's.

So you can only imagine the strange signals you send to the search engines when you wrap your sidebar's titles with an h2 tag. How many of your sidebar's titles have pertinent information in them, and how many look like mine with sections like 'must read' or 'categories'?

## The Simple Solution

Even if you aren't super tech savvy this isn't a tough problem to fix. Let's break it down into three easy steps.

1. Do you need to make a change?
If your sidebar's titles have important key phrases in them already, there is no need to make a change. Likewise, if you happen to know that your sidebar titles are wrapped in h3's or h4's there is no need to worry.
2. Access your sidebar
In WordPress, the sidebar is usually kept in a sidebar.php file. You may want to do a Google search to figure out how to edit your blog's sidebar.
3. Switch h2's to h3's
Go through your sidebar and switch any &lt;h2&gt; tags with &lt;h3&gt; or &lt;h4&gt;
This should change &lt;h2&gt;Categories&lt;/h2&gt; to &lt;h3&gt;Categories&lt;/h3&gt;

There you have it folks!

Save your h1's and h2's for something important, but keep your sidebar usable for your visitors.
