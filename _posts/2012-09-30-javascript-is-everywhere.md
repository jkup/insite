Today, I began what I hope will be a long lasting relationship with <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.

## Epiphany Strikes

A few weeks ago, I was listening to a <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/031-with-matt-mullenweg/">podcast featuring Matt Mullenweg</a> - founder of WordPress. The topic of most interesting programming languages came up and Matt started talking about JavaScript.

After listening to the podcast I looked into what cool and interesting things were being done with JavaScript and boy did I find a lot.

## JavaScript in the Browser

Chances are if you're familiar with JavaScript, you know it in the browser. With the help of libraries like <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://mootools.net/">MooTools</a> JavaScript is the language of interaction on the web. With it you can make animations, video games and even <a href="http://simplecartjs.org/">shopping carts</a> .

This alone makes JavaScript a pretty fantastic language but I was really surprised to find its less common uses.

##  JavaScript on the Server

Until now(ish), JavaScript has been thought of as an exclusively front-end, browser-based technology. With the introduction of node.js you can run JavaScript as your server side language. This offers a whole lot of functionality I'm not nearly adept enough to understand.

I've spent the better part of a day playing around with node.js and it's really changing the way I think about development. Here are  a few quick notes - I hope to post a lot more about it later.

1. It comes with the Node Package Manager(NPM) It allows you to easily grab modules(helpers and plugins) and seamlessly keep them organized and up to date.
2. By necessity you control a lot more out of the box. It isn't a simple scripting language so you can't just have a single line of code. You need to use the http client and set some parameters in order to get started.
3. You can run separate scripts as either web based or inside the terminal. I've actually been using node.js to make some simple linux helper scripts.

## JavaScript Controlling Robots

This was the final kicker for me. People are <a href="http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-arduino-programming-with-nodejs/">using JavaScript to control robotics like Arduino boards</a>. I've seen some pretty cool stuff like one guy built a tweet notifier and others are making programmable arms.

## JavaScript IS Everywhere

I think the moral to the story is that JavaScript has a good chance of being the language of the future. It's widely supported, well documented and can be used for just about anything.

I feel comfortable saying that at the very least, *If you could only learn one language and wanted to pick the one that would give you the most bang for your buck - I would recommend JavaScript.*
