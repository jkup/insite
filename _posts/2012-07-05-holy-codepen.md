Have you checked out this <a href="http://codepen.io/">sweet new web app</a>? You should!

## Enter Codepen.io

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2248" title="codepen_screenshot" src="{{ site.url }}/images/codepen_screenshot1.png" alt="" /></div>

Bam, it feels like JSFiddle with whimsy.

The home page displaysÂ **editors choice** projects ( or pens ) in an inviting, easy to use fashion.

It's really self explanatory ( clearly made by front-end folks ) so I won't bore you with a full report. However, here are my highlights:

+ Easy to use
+ Embed your pens into any website
+ Easily build pens with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
+ Include JS libraries like jQuery, MooTools and Prototype
+ Easily link Codepen to your Github account
+ Have your work seen by others, and share pens you think are awesome

That's really all you need to know, <a href="http://codepen.io/">go check it out</a>!
