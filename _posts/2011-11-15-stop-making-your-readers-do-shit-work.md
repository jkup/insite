## Reading Your Blog Should Not Feel Like Mining For Coal

I love reading blogs; I love commenting on blogs.

That being said, there is **nothing** I hate more than when a blog makes me feel like I'm working instead of leisurely reading an article.

Here are just a few things that make me cringe.

### **1. Not Being Able To Leave A Comment**

I'm trying to be nice and leave you a comment here, why are you making it so hard for me? Here are things you *probably* shouldn't be doing:

Re-Captcha
<div class="img-wrap"><img title="re-captcha" src="{{ site.url }}/images/re-captcha.jpg" alt="" /></div>

I get the idea here, but weigh the pros and cons for a minute. On the one hand you do prevent a great deal of comment spam. On the other, your making every potential fan and reader of your blog squint their eyes at these stupid looking, hard to read words and fill out a test just to say hi to you.

### **2. Spam Without Reason**

<div class="img-wrap"><img title="spam-comment" src="{{ site.url }}/images/spam-comment.jpg" alt="" /></div>

This is one of the most frustrating things I've come across. I go to leave a nice comment on someone's blog and get a generic error message saying my comment has been deleted as spam with no explanation

### **3. Facebook Comment System**

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1763" title="facebook_comment_system" src="{{ site.url }}/images/facebook_comment_system.jpg" alt="" /></div>

I can't even begin to count how many times I've gone to leave a nice comment on a blog but left the site instead because of Facebook comment plugins. I like being able to leave an anonymous comment, and not let you and everyone else see a link to my personal Facebook page.

### **4. Evil Popup Subscription Box**

Despite statistics telling you that you'll get 125% more conversions by signing up for a popup subscription service, they can drive a way a bulk of your visitors. A basic rule that I always follow is to ask myself if any **really successful **websites are using a particular plugin or method. If you can't think of a single big site using a method, it's probably not worth using.

### **4. Way Too Many Marketing Plugins**

I really considered posting a few screenshots of blogs that make my eyes bleed but I thought it might be insulting.

The point here being that plugins like SexyBookmarks, Sharebar and Slideshare are totally great for your visitors but **there's a limit.**

If the point of your blog is having users read your content, why clutter up the content area with a bunch of crap?

### **5. No Obvious Way To Comment Or Share**

This goes against the last point, but not really. Not allowing your readers to leave you a comment or share your post is like shooting yourself in the foot. Why on earth would you not want people to tell you how much they like your blog or share it with their friends? Spend the 10 minutes getting your blog ready for comments and social media, it's definitely worth it.
