I'm Â not usually big on using this blog to keep up with the current events or the latest news but I think SOPA merits the attention.

### Internet Dwellers Can All Rest Easy Today, SOPA Has Been Shelved

According to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204167-sopa-shelved-until-consensus-is-found">The Hill</a>

<blockquote>House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said early Saturday morning that Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) promised him the House will not vote on the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) unless there is consensus on the bill.</blockquote>

So no more need to worry about losing our right to free speech online, or great websites like Youtube and Facebook being reduced to rubble. For now at least, we have our good ole' internet back.
