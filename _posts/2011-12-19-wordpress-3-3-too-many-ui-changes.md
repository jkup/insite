## WordPress 3.3 Is Here!

The most widely used Content Management System -- WordPress -- has come out with yet another great release. With a stunning new interface and some great new features, it's going to get developers like myself feeling like Christmas came early.

WordPress 3.3 brings a great many new things to the table. Perhaps two of the most notable are a new admin interface and combining all forms of media into a simple upload button. As a developer, I love how frequently WordPress comes out with great new updates and how frequently their interface changes to accommodate the growing needs of the system. There is,  however, one small detail I feel like WordPress is missing.

**Developers aren't the only ones using WordPress.**

Not even close.

As much as I love all the new changes constantly coming to WordPress, I hate walking all of my clients through a *scary* new system and answering questions like:

<blockquote>Why can't I have the old menus back?</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>Why does is update so frequently?</blockquote>

I can't help but feel as though 3+ User Interface changes in one year is excessive for a piece of software that markets itself to the non technically savvy.
