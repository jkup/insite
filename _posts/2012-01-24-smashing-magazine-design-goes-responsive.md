A while back I <a title="Responsive Web Design – Praised But Unused" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/responsive-web-design-praised-but-unused/">wrote a post</a> 'calling out' popular web design blogs for singing the praises of responsive design but not actually implementing it on their sites.

Today I noticed that <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> has re-designed with one of the most incredible designs I've ever seen.

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2008" title="smashing_magazine_responsive_design_insite" src="{{ site.url }}/images/smashing_magazine_responsive_design_insite.jpg" alt="Smashing Magazine Design Goes Responsive" /></a></div>

## There's Something To This Design

Smashing Magazine is a great resource despite the design. If you aren't familiar with it ( you must be new or living under a rock ) but it's the holy grail of web design sites. They have some of the best articles ever written and they sponsor almost all of my favorite blogs with their Smashing Network.

I really recommend going and checking out this design. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think it's the greatest design I've ever seen.

The things I have noticed are:

+ The UX is **amazing**. Everything is right where you think it should be.
+ The Degrade is flawless. Re-sizing the window from 1900+ pixels to 200 is one of the smoothest transitions I've seen.
+ The Buttons are fun to click. This is an effect that I always strive for, getting more CTR through buttons that your users **want** to click.
+ The comments are easy to read. Another tough accomplishment. Comments are often ugly and deemed not worth reading but Smashing Magazine's design makes you want to read other people comments.
+ The fonts are awesome. I've been wanting to start using paid web font programs like <a href="https://typekit.com/">TypeKit</a> for a while now, sometimes they are really worth the cost.
+ The content is top-notch. They always have amazing images and fantastic content.

## What Do You Think Of The Design

Am I over-reacting here; Or is this one of the greatest designs on the web?
