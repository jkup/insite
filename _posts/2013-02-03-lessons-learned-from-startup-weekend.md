This weekend I attended my first <a href="http://annarbor.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a>.

<div class="img-wrap"><img src="{{ site_url }}/images/startup_weekend.jpg" /></div>

The event went from Friday at 6pm until the following Sunday at 3:30pm.

The days were broken down like this:

<h2>Friday</h2>

Gather for orientation at 6pm. We checked in and had pizza and drinks in a big meeting room. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dtrenz">@dtrenz</a> and some other friends from my Meetup group were there and it was fun to catch up while we ate.

After we were all done eating, we were brought into the large auditorium for the 'pitchfire' event. Before we got started -- the people at <a href="http://rapt.fm/">Rapt.FM</a> showed us their new KickStarted video and gave a pretty inspiring presentation.

Their CEO, Erik Torenberg, gave a really inspiring speech about his experiences with Startup Weekend events. He talked about his first event, driving down to Chicago with some of his friends, and the mistakes they made. He told us that his pitch was well recieved and he ended up being in charge of his our Startup Group. He talked about how the group completely fell apart and jokingly (I hope) said his team didn't even get the free point from the judges for participation.

After that the 'pitchfire' began. Anyone that wanted could get in line and give a 60 second pitch for their startup idea. I think all in all there were 54 pitches on Friday. The ideas largely consisted of:

+ Mobile Applications
+ Crowdsourcing / Crowdfunding specialties
+ Educational Websites
+ Games

When the pitches were finished, each person who pitched got a piece of paper with their startups name on it and we moved back into the meeting room to vote on our favorites.

This is the first thing I think should have been done differently. The people who pitched were awkwardly wandering around the room with their sheet of paper, trying to get votes ( sticky notes that every participant recieved three of ). There were a few problems with this:

1. It was really hard to find a specific startup as they wandered around the room.
2. It was hard to talk about your favorites with hopeful pitchers standing over your shoulder.
3. It was pretty awkward when a good 70% of them got no votes.
4. Things got really awkward when <a href="http://www.twitter.com/aiwdesign">@aiwdesign</a> and I ended up some of the last people with all of our votes left.

If I were in charge I would have had all the pitchers stand at the front of the room giving out more details of their startup. Then I would have had a nice web application that allowed for anonymous voting.

When the voting was done the group in charge picked the 10 most popular and the rest of the startup ideas were tossed.

Then came the second most awkward part of the evening. With the 10 groups remaining the rest of us had to decide which group to join.

**Everyone wanted mobile developers**

I think <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dtrenz">@dtrenz</a> was one of the few lucky enough to end up in a group with one.

<h3>Our First Big Mistake</h3>

We overcommitted ourselves. We found a group that wanted to make a mobile application for the popular game Assassin. We (despite having no experience) volunteered to use PhoneGap to publish a native app that would help facilitate playing the game.

We ended up in a group of 9, sitting upstairs talking about the game and how much more fun it would be if we could add:

+ Automatic target assignment
+ GPS tracking
+ In-app purchases
+ Facebook integration

<h3>Our Second Big Mistake</h3>

We delegated poorly. Our group had three of us that could write code. The other six were able to put together a logo but most of the time were left to brainstorm new ideas. This was a partciularly bad setup for a few reasons.
