Recently, CSS Frameworks have started to dominate the web. They are particularly useful, especially for start-ups that need a site built fast.

## What Are CSS Frameworks

A CSS Framework is a stylesheet you can use to rapidly prototype your website. Essentially, they give you a bunch of classes and ID's you can use that make your website look sweet. The two most popular CSS Frameworks on the market right now are <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>.

## Which One Is Better

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2590" title="cssframeworks" src="{{ site.url }}/images/cssframeworks.jpg" alt="" /></div>

tl;dr I like Foundation better.

The folks over at Design Shack did a <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/framework-fight-zurb-foundation-vs-twitter-bootstrap/">pretty nice comparison</a> that I agree with.

They are both nice looking, responsive and come with all the styles you should need for your project. I happen to like the buttons and typography that Foundation provides a bit better and I'm getting a little tired of seeing Bootstrap everywhere.

Normally I try hard not to hate things just because they are popular, but seeing the same buttons / forms / typography on dozens of websites each day gets me a little tired of them.

## Some Good Must Come Of This

A while ago, I (think) I heard <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/">Chris Coyier</a> talking about the potentials pros of having Twitter Bootstrap all over the place. He mentioned the usability gains for users that see the same CSS elements all over the place. I see some merit to that. I think users might enjoy seeing similar buttons and forms on many of the services they use.
