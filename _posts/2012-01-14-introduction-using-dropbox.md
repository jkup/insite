<a href="http://db.tt/lUqZgvl">Dropbox</a> is one of my favorite pieces of software available Today.
## What Is Dropbox
Simply put, Dropbox is file sharing software that allows you to easily share files with the public, friends and family or yourself on different computers.

## How To Install Dropbox

**Step 1 - **Go To The <a href="http://db.tt/lUqZgvl">Dropbox Website</a>

You should see something like this:

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1857" title="welcome_to_dropbox" src="{{ site.url }}/images/welcome_to_dropbox.jpg" alt="how to install dropbox" /></div>

**Step 2 - **Download Dropbox

Click the download button and it should take you to a screen that looks like this:

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1858" title="downloading_dropbox" src="{{ site.url }}/images/downloading_dropbox.jpg" alt="how to download dropbox" /></div>

Follow the normal steps you follow whenever installing software on your computer. I recommend going with the default Dropbox installation. If you already have a dropbox account, you enter your information at the end of the installation. If you need a new account, there is an option for that and you can create a new account without leaving the page.

After you've completed the installation and have dropbox synced to your account. You should open **Finder** ( on a Mac ) or **Windows Explorer** ( On PC ) and you should see something similar to this:

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1873" title="installed_dropbox" src="{{ site.url }}/images/installed_dropbox.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Now you can use your Dropbox folder just like any other folder on your computer. Unlike other folders however, anything you put in Dropbox can both be shared publicly if you'd like or retrieved from any other computer you give permission to.
