I've received a lot of questions recently on how to sign in to your WordPress Blog. This tutorial will show you how to sign in to your WordPress Dashboard whether you are using <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> or a stand alone <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a> blog.
## How To Sign In To WordPress.com
This one is pretty straightforward. All you need to do is go to <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> and you'll see the username / password boxes at the top left of the website.
## How To Sign In To Your WordPress.org Blog
Go to the home page of your website, let's say http://www.mywebsite.com/ and in the URL bar add either **/wp-admin** or **/wp-login.php**. This would give you either
<p style="text-align: center;">http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-admin</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">        or</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">http://www.mywebsite.com/wp-login.php</p>

<div style="margin-top: 50px;">Then just enter your username and password combination.</div>
