As I make my way though beginner designs and become more concerned with creating designs that look great on all devices and browsers I discover that I need a lot more tools than I previously thought.

Let's take a look at some of the tools that make really great web design possible:

## Compass

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1233" title="compass" src="{{ site.url }}/images/compass.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="144" /></div>

<a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> is a *CSS Authoring Framework*. In essence, it's a program that allows you to quickly write valid CSS. It's a really awesome tool that comes with a lot of great plugins. It's really worth checking out, as is this awesome <a href="http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/88-intro-to-compass-sass/">CSS-Tricks podcast</a> on how to use it.

## HTML5 Boilerplate

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1236" title="html5_boilerplate" src="{{ site.url }}/images/html5_boilerplate.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> is a *professional badass's base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-proof site. *This is a boilerplate that supports ie6 as well as HTML5. It does it all, including mobile browser support. It's a truly great project run by some of the best web developers this world's ever seen.

## Modernizr

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1239" title="modernizr" src="{{ site.url }}/images/modernizr.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<a href="http://www.modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> is an *open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites. *Modernizr uses Javascript for what it calls *feature detection*. Essentially it detects what browser the user is viewing your site with and what CSS and HTML features that browser can handle. Then it serves code that the browser can handle.

## Jquery

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1240" title="jquery" src="{{ site.url }}/images/jquery.jpg" alt="" /></div>

If you're not currently using <a href="http://jquery.com/">Jquery</a>, you're missing out! Jquery is the *Write less, Do more *JavaScript library. It's a great front end tool that allows you to do most of your favorite JavaScript things way faster!
