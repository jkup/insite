Undoubtedly two of the hottest topics in the web industry are **Search Engine Optimization** and **User Experience. **When done well, it is possible to find a magnificent balance and create a successful website. Unfortunately, this balance is difficult to come by and often leaves sites tipping too far to one side. Before we go any further let's define these terms:

**Search Engine Optimization ( SEO ):**

The process of adjusting the content, structure, etc,of a website so that it will be displayed prominently by a search engine.**

**User Experience ( UX ):**

A subset of the field of <a title="Experience design" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_design">experience design</a> that pertains to the creation of the architecture and interaction models that affect <a title="User experience" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">user experience</a> of a device or system.

## **A Tale Of Opposites**

Although these two concepts can work together harmoniously, they are often each other's worst enemies. **SEO** can be simplified and defined as *Designing For Computers.* **UX** on the other hand can be over-simplified and described as *Designing For Humans.*

### **The Battle Begins**

Let's take a look at an important part of any website, the headlines. Whether your  website is a blog that needs killer headlines to get clicks or a corporate business page -- your headlines need to generate interest.

### **So, What's The Problem?**

Let's pretend we're sitting in a room with an **SEO** expert and a **UX** designer. We tell them we're writing a blog article about WordPress and we need their help picking a killer headline. The thought processes would look something like this.

*SEO Expert: Let me do keyword analysis and figure out which WordPress related terms are the most viable for Search Engine traffic. We'll put the list together and find a title that will guarantee you a lot of hits on Google.*

This would probably land us a headline like: **Introduction To WordPress.**

*UX Expert: Let me analyze the demographics of your website visitors, after I figure out as much as I can I'll write you something snappy that will guarantee clicks.*

This would probably land us a headline like: **Forget Everything You Thought You Knew About WordPress.**

Now let's analyze these titles.

### **The SEO Expert**

Now SEO provides great benefit to websites, but there is a drawback. Again, let's over-simplify. Search Engine Optimization is a great tool, it will help you attract new visitors that wouldn't otherwise find your website. By showing up higher in the search engines you can reach a larger audience.

The drawback to this is robotic content that won't keep users around for long. While attracting new users is always important, keeping them around and loyal is what leads to *real conversions.*

### **The UX Designer**

UX is a fantastic field that can make all the difference in your websites success. A great UX designer can create websites that serve their intended purpose beautifully. Whether your website aims to sell products or services or inform and educate; UX designers act as a blanket between humans and computers.

All of this is great, but it doesn't do a bit of good if no one ever finds your website. You can have great content and a wonderful design but one way or another you need to get that initial burst of traffic or it's all moot.

## **The Conclusion**

Websites have become devalued, the entire industry has. Many people gawk at a $2,000 price tag on a well designed site. If you are serious about the website you are creating, you should at least consider the benefits of hiring a UX consultant and an SEO marketing firm.
