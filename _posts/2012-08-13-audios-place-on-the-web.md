I started off this week reading Luke Wroblewski's *Mobile First**.***

<div class="img-wrap"><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2356" title="mobile_first" src="{{ site.url }}/images/mobile_first.jpeg" alt="" /></a></div>

If you haven't read it already, you really should; It's an incredible read.

Anyway, Luke got me thinking about so much. Mobile technology, native apps vs. mobile websites but what I found most interesting was his ideas of designing applications that make use of the new ways people use mobile devices. I'm talking about swiping, tapping, tilting websites.

## Audio on a Blog

Today, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.damienelsing.com/">Damien Elsing's Blog</a> and noticed something strange on his sidebar:

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2358" title="voice_message" src="{{ site.url }}/images/voice_message.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Check that out, on the right side there is a tooltip asking you to leave an audio message as feedback on his blog.

### The First Step

My immediate reaction was that asking for audio feedback is a bad idea. Thinking about recording a message on Damien's blog seemed like an awkward experience. It also filled my with questions:

+ What is the experience going to be like?
+ Will I have a chance to listen to my message before I send it?
+ Who's going to be listening to this message?
+ How many blog readers are properly set up to leave an audio message?

### The Reality

Curiosity got the best of me and I clicked the leave feedback button which answered a few of my questions. It seems like you can record before sending and the technology that Damien is using for audio recording is Adobe's Flash Player.

Unfortunately, I'm a bit too security conscious to give Adobe permissions to my mic and webcam so I didn't leave a message. However just because we have barriers today doesn't mean that audio comments are bust.

I think that if more blogs and websites started offering blogging comments it could be a really great means for 1 way communication. Text seems to be advantageous in that it can be read by everyone who stops through.

Any of you using audio on your websites? Care to share your experience?
