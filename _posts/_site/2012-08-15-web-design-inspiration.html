<p>When I first started my career, I derived 100% of my inspiration from other websites. When beginning a design, I&#8217;d search around for 5 or 6 websites in a competitive area. I&#8217;d find my favorite things about each, and sloppily stick them all together to create something that, although decent looking, was without purpose.</p>

<p>My first job within the industry was an internship with a <a href='http://3.7designs.co'>local web firm</a>. I distinctly remember talking to the owner once and being totally shocked when he told me he derived his inspiration from designer products in no way related to the web.</p>

<p>I really liked his philosophy but just wasn&#8217;t a good enough designer to cross mediums in such a way.</p>

<p>As my career has progressed, I find myself getting inspired from minutiae of other websites. I recognize this to be a sign that I still have a long way to go in my career as a designer but I think it&#8217;s a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Often times I&#8217;ll see a color swatch, a great font combination or a well functioning layout and a full website design will come from it. I think at this point I&#8217;ve simply built enough websites to fill in details after laying some ground work.</p>

<p>In the coming years, I&#8217;d like to get to the point where my design inspiration comes from others forms of media besides the web. I&#8217;d like to create designs inspired from beautiful landscapes, creative packaging and really work on finding a style that is my own.</p>

<p>Where do you find your inspiration for the web? Did you follow a path similar to mine or have you had different experiences? I&#8217;d love it if you left some of your thoughts in the comments section below!</p>
