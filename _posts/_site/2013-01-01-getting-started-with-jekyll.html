<p>I&#8217;ve been really interested in checking out <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> for a while now.</p>

<p>According to their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah. That didn&#8217;t clear things up for me either.</p>

<p>Basically, Jekyll is a great little ruby program that allows you to make a blog with all the bells and whistles you&#8217;re used to, and then export the entire thing into fast, secure, cachable HTML files.</p>

<h1 id='getting_started'>Getting Started</h1>

<p>I found the actual Jekyll install a bit confusing. So I started with this <a href='https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base'>Jekyll Base</a> project that Daniel McGraw has been working on.</p>

<p>You should see something like this after you download it:</p>
<pre rel='File Structure'><code>
    | _layouts
    | _posts
    | README.md
    | _config.yml
    | index.html
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Download that project from github and stash it in a folder. Next we need to install Jekyll.</p>

<h2 id='installation'>Installation</h2>

<p>Fire up that terminal ( I know it can be scary but this is pretty painless! )</p>
<pre>
    sudo gem install jekyll
</pre>
<p>Assuming you already have ruby installed that should take care of that. Otherwise you might have to install ruby manually but that&#8217;s not for this tutorial.</p>

<p>Next step, and this is totally optional is to install RDiscount so we can use Markdown to make blog posts.</p>
<pre>
    sudo gem install rdiscount
</pre>
<p>We&#8217;re good to go!</p>

<h2 id='the_setup'>The Setup</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s move to that folder where you put Daniel&#8217;s Jekyll Base.</p>

<p>Pop open your terminal and change directory to that folder.</p>
<pre>
    cd ~/path/to/that/folder
</pre>
<p>Then type:</p>
<pre>
    jekyll --server
</pre>
<p>In order for Jekyll to update files as you edit, the terminal running jekyll &#8211;server either needs to be left on or turned on after each change and before you expect to see anything in the browser.</p>

<p>Then open up your favorite browser and navigation to:</p>

<p>http://localhost:4000</p>

<p>and there you have it!</p>

<p>If you look back in your file directory, you&#8217;ll see that Jekyll added some more files and folders. For more information on what those are and why they&#8217;re important, check out Daniel&#8217;s post <a href='http://danielmcgraw.com/2011/04/18/The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Getting-Started-With-Jekyll-Part-2/'>on his personal blog</a>. We&#8217;re just going to jump right in!</p>

<h2 id='writing_your_first_post'>Writing Your First Post</h2>

<p>Open up your favorite text editor and use it to open <em>posts/1985-10-26-Test-Post.md. You should see something like this:</em></p>
<pre rel='Markdown'><code>
---
layout: post
title: Test Post
---

This is a test post writen in markdown. To learn more about markdown check out the 
[documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) on 
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/).
</code></pre>
<p>Like the post says, if you want more information on Markdown, check out <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Daring Fireball</a></p>

<p>Go ahead and get your hands dirty! Use that Daring Fireball post to figure out the syntax of Markdown. Feel free to just use regular HTML if you prefer although I think you&#8217;ll find Markdown very elegant. If you want to change the &#8216;date&#8217; of the post, just change the date in the filename. When you&#8217;re ready to see your post, just head over to the browser and refresh.</p>

<h2 id='deployment'>Deployment</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to do a whole series on Jekyll deployment. For now, just know that you can take the entire contents of <em>site and stick them on the web via FTP. They should be all good to go.</em></p>

<h2 id='common_pitfalls'>Common Pitfalls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Remember that jekyll &#8211;server both compiles all your Jekyll code into HTML and is needed for local viewing.</li>

<li>Before trying anything tricky, check if there is already a <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins'>plugin</a> for what you&#8217;re attempting.</li>

<li>Make backups before trying to export your current blog format to Jekyll ( there are good tools but it can get messy ).</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you&#8217;re moving from a more robust platform like WordPress here are some things you&#8217;ll need to figure out that Jekyll doesn&#8217;t offer out of the box.</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom 404 page ( use htaccess )</li>

<li>sitemap ( Jekyll plugin )</li>

<li>RSS Feed ( Jekyll plugin )</li>

<li>Pretty Permalinks ( edit <em>config.yml )</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='good_luck_out_there'>Good Luck Out There</h2>

<p>Let me know in the comments if any of this was unclear or just isn&#8217;t working. I&#8217;m planning on doing <strong>a lot</strong> more posts on Jekyll so check back soon!</p>
