<p>Cold calls, email blasts, commercials and radio shout-outs are a thing of the past.</p>

<p>When paying for outbound marketing methods  such as these, there are far too many pitfalls that may render your efforts worthless. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caller ID, Mute Buttons and AD Blockers often render these tactics completely ineffective.</li>

<li>Even if you do the correct research, these methods don&#8217;t attract pre-qualified leads</li>
</ul>

<p>Living in a world completely saturated with advertisements, it&#8217;s difficult for one particular ad to penetrate and be truly effective.</p>

<ul>
<li>You become an authority in your field.</li>

<li>Potential clients will associate you with your topic or service.</li>

<li>You&#8217;ll be able to network well with others in your industry.</li>

<p>In this day and age, customers are particularly disinterested in outbound marketing methods such as cold calling because of the internet. They don&#8217;t want to be bothered with weighing the pros and cons of a decision before that product or service is a necessity.</p>

<p><em>I don&#8217;t want to think about who is going to do my taxes until the year is up.</em></p>

<p>When a need arises for a particular good or service, customers go to their computers, type in a customized search query and start looking for someone to fill that need. This is where you, and your inbound marketing efforts come in.</p>
