<p>I&#8217;m starting a new section here on the Insite Design Lab Blog called <strong>Decision Time</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be a running meme where I write about decisions I&#8217;m constantly flip-flopping between. This first segment is going to be:</p>

<p>I recently wrote a blog post <a title='What Is The Best Web Browser' href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/what-is-the-best-web-browser/'>comparing the different web browsers</a> in a general sense. This post is about which web browser is my personal favorite and why I have such a difficult time deciding on just one.</p>

<h2 id='the_contenders'>The Contenders</h2>

<p>To be totally honest there are only ever two web browsers that contend for the <em>top spot</em> in my book.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google Chrome</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mozilla FireFox</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I constantly go back and forth between the two of them, and I&#8217;m never sure which one to consider my absolute favorite.</p>

<h2 id='the_runners_up'>The Runners Up</h2>

<p>Although they never make it to my top-spot, there are two browsers which deserve honorable mention.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Safari</strong></li>

<li><strong>The Opera Browser</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Apple Safari -</strong>The only reason I&#8217;m really giving Safari the honorable mention is because of screenshots. If I&#8217;m making a blog post, presentation or tutorial, nothing looks quite as sharp as a screenshot taken on a Mac, using Safari. It&#8217;s a really sleek looking browsers and despite not being on my favorites list, it&#8217;s a necessary part of my arsenal.</p>

<p><strong>The Opera Browser -</strong> RSS Feeds are something I&#8217;ve always struggled with. I read <strong>a lot</strong> of blogs every day and I&#8217;d love to have an easy way to aggregate them all together.</p>

<h2 id='the_tough_call'>The Tough Call</h2>

<p><strong>Mozilla FireFox:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Amazing features</li>

<li>Firebug for development</li>

<li>Fantastic looks</li>

<li>Great add-ons</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Blazing fast speeds</li>

<li>The latest features</li>

<li>not-as-good but still awesome developer tools and extensions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='the_question'>The Question</h2>

<p>What are your favorite browsers and why do you think they&#8217;re better than the rest?</p>

<p>How often do you switch between browsers and why?</p>
