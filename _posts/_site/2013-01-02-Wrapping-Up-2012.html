<p>It&#8217;s been a crazy year.</p>

<p>I know January is a bit late for an end of the year wrap-up but the end of the year came and went so quickly.</p>

<p>Last year, I wrote <a href='/2011-review-a-thank-you/'>an article</a> wrapping up the first year of this blog and highlighting some goals for 2012. Looking back on my goals I&#8217;m surprised both at how few I achieved as well as how much my priorities have shifted.</p>

<h2 id='goals_for_2012'>Goals For 2012</h2>

<p>My goals for this past year were to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write an e-book and give it away to my readers. Preferably something on Search Engine Optimization or Online Marketing.</li>

<li>Write guest posts for at least 5 blogs more popular than mine.</li>

<li>Make friends with other starting bloggers, it gets lonely sometimes :)</li>

<li>Write at least 100 articles. ( Twice as many as this year )</li>

<li>Start posting video screencasts as an alternative way to deliver information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Publish an Ebook</strong> - This has fallen completely off my radar. I like the idea of publishing work longer than a blog post but I&#8217;m not so interested in SEO and Internet Marketing right now.</p>

<p><strong>Guest Posts</strong> - This still interests me, but I wrote a whopping 0 guest posts last year.</p>

<p><strong>Make Friends</strong> - This has proven quite successful! I&#8217;ve become involved ( now teaching ) at my local <a href='http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/'>PHP Meetup Group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Write 100 Posts</strong> - I didn&#8217;t even make sixty. Still, more than last year&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Start with Screencasts</strong> - Still on the to-do list.</p>

<p>Pretty depressing at first glance, but I&#8217;ve accomplished quite a bit in other areas.</p>

<h2 id='accomplishments_in_2012'>Accomplishments In 2012</h2>

<p>All in all this has been a pretty incredible year. In January I started a paid internship with a <a href='http://wojodesign.com/'>great web design firm</a> which helped push my skills to the next level. Working for Wojo Design really helped my figure out what I want to do for my career ( despite it being different from what I was doing for them ).</p>

<h3 id='php'>PHP</h3>

<p>I really thought that front-end design and WordPress were the tools for me. Then, this year, I started to develop PHP applications pretty heavily and fell in love. Back-end development has become my obsession. I&#8217;ve built Social Networks, Photo Sharing Applications, Blog&#8217;s, Content Management Systems and I&#8217;m just getting started!</p>

<h3 id='new_technologies'>New Technologies</h3>

<p>I recently migrated both my <a href='http://www.jonkuperman.com/'>personal blog</a> as well as my company blog from WordPress to <a href='/getting-started-with-jekyll/'>Jekyll</a>. It&#8217;s been a really fun project and the results are amazing!</p>

<h3 id='php_meetup_group'>PHP Meetup Group</h3>

<p>Our local <a href='http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/'>PHP Meetup Group</a> has gained a lot of traction this year. It has become one of the things I most look forward to and I hope it keeps going at its current pace.</p>

<h3 id='a_job'>A Job</h3>

<p>In a strange twist of fate, I landed ( my first ) full-time job at the end of this year. I&#8217;ve started working for a <a href='http://www.medhub.com/'>Medical Software</a> company and so far it&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

<h2 id='goals_for_2013'>Goals For 2013</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m going to try and outline a few general goals for the upcoming year. As long as I learn a lot in my field and have a ton of fun I&#8217;ll be satisfied but having a written list of goals seems like the right thing to do.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gain proficiency in PHP, JavaScript, Git, and CSS.</li>

<li>Write more.</li>

<li>Teach More.</li>

<li>Actually start making screencasts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thanks to everyone who reads and leaves comments on this blog. It&#8217;s really become a huge part of my life and I can&#8217;t tell you how much readership and feedback means to me!</p>

<p>And now, the ubiquitous end of the year post is over. Thanks for bearing with me!</p>
