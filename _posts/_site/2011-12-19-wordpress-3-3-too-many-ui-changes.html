<h2 id='wordpress_33_is_here'>WordPress 3.3 Is Here!</h2>

<p>The most widely used Content Management System &#8211; WordPress &#8211; has come out with yet another great release. With a stunning new interface and some great new features, it&#8217;s going to get developers like myself feeling like Christmas came early.</p>

<p>WordPress 3.3 brings a great many new things to the table. Perhaps two of the most notable are a new admin interface and combining all forms of media into a simple upload button. As a developer, I love how frequently WordPress comes out with great new updates and how frequently their interface changes to accommodate the growing needs of the system. There is,  however, one small detail I feel like WordPress is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Developers aren&#8217;t the only ones using WordPress.</strong></p>

<p>Not even close.</p>

<p>As much as I love all the new changes constantly coming to WordPress, I hate walking all of my clients through a <em>scary</em> new system and answering questions like:</p>
<blockquote>Why can't I have the old menus back?</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>Why does is update so frequently?</blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel as though 3+ User Interface changes in one year is excessive for a piece of software that markets itself to the non technically savvy.</p>
