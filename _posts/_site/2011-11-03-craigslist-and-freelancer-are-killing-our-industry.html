<p>It isn&#8217;t often that I pop on websites such as Craigslist.org or Freelancer.com but today I did and what I saw made me sad.</p>

<p>Companies hiring SEO consultants at $8.50 per hour, WordPress themes being bought and sold at under $200, and everything I love in this industry being devalued. Consider this a call to action for you poor souls out their who have become so convinced of your lack of worth that you consider providing your professional services at Taco Bell prices.</p>

<h3 id='the_problem'>The Problem</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t get this twisted as coming from a place of fear. I have no concern for my place in the web design industry, because I know what my services are worth and have no problem convincing the world that I&#8217;m right. The only concern I have is for what I like to call the <em>Fast Food Effect</em> coming to the design industry.</p>

<p>Fast Food Restaurants have flooded our towns and cities, slinging their disgusting food for rock bottom prices resulting in, well, a shift in the quality of food we eat. Now, premiere restaurants with great chef&#8217;s certainly aren&#8217;t suffering because a new McDonalds opened up down the street, so you may be asking yourself what harm this causes. Well I&#8217;ll tell you.</p>

<p>The harm is done to the poor kids who end up working in these crap holes, and more importantly to the general public who grow up thinking that McDonalds and Taco Bell are suitable replacements for food. Let&#8217;s tackle these one at a time.</p>

<h3 id='the_employees'>The Employees.</h3>

<p>Now, in our country unemployment is at an all time high, which simply means that back in the day there were more jobs available per person than there are now. I want to get that out of the way so no one tosses up the &#8221;<em>Hey, but they create jobs, right?&#8221;</em> argument. If children weren&#8217;t getting their first jobs slinging burgers at some greasy smelly fast food joint, they would be getting entry level positions at jobs that actually have  room for upward mobility. No one gets a job at Taco Bell because they want to become a chef one day, they do it because we&#8217;ve let those filthy shops overrun our towns and now there&#8217;s nothing left.</p>

<h3 id='the_public'>The Public.</h3>

<p>There are few things that I appreciate and enjoy as much as a good meal. However, McDonalds and Taco Bell are not food. By definition, food is: <em>any nourishing substance that is eaten, drunk, or otherwise taken into the body to sustain life, provide energy, promote growth, etc.</em></p>

<p>And we know for a fact that fast food does not nourish and cannot sustain life. So the real problem becomes the general public is saddled with the misconception that the crap they eat everyday is food. Many don&#8217;t get to appeciate the joy of quality food nor the feeling of a chemical and fat free existence.</p>

<h3 id='what_about_web_design'>What About Web Design?</h3>

<p>The same principles apply to almost any industry. But perhaps none so much as web design and internet marketing. Take a company hiring an <em>SEO Expert</em> but only willing to pay $8.50 per hour. Unless our economy gets <strong>a lot</strong> worse, there is no chance someone possessing the skills and experience that go along with true <em>Search Engine Optimization</em> is going to fall so low as to take a job for $8.50 per hour. It just doesn&#8217;t happen. Leaving one of two possibilities.</p>

<h4 id='the_company_will_learn'>The Company Will Learn.</h4>

<p>In an ideal world, the company would go weeks or months without a single reply to their post, and eventually stumble to the conclusion that if they want an SEO expert, they are going to need to shell out a fair wage.</p>

<h4 id='they_hire_a_mcexpert'>They Hire A McExpert.</h4>

<p>Much more probably however is that the company will get at least one application from someone who knows little more than what the acronym stands for and hire what the believe to be an SEO expert. Months later they will see little to know improvement in their rankings or websites, and like so many others will begin to see the field as a joke, devaluing the industry.</p>

<p>Web Design is no different. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all noticed the influx of crappy cut-out websites popping up on the internet. Websites like Wix pose no direct threat to web designers but they inarguable cheapen the industry.</p>

<h3 id='the_resulting_question'>The resulting question:</h3>
<blockquote>How Do You Compete With The Foreign Design Firms Charging $5 per hour For Web Design Work?</blockquote>
<p><strong>I Don&#8217;t.</strong></p>

<p>*<strong><em>Why would you want to? There is no trick to having a cheap website. If you pay 50% less than your local firms are charging, you&#8217;re certainly making sacrifices. Whether those sacrifices are usability, design, sustainability or what have you. <strong>You didn&#8217;t save money, you bought something that was <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>worth less.</span></strong></em></strong></p>

<p>Most of my clients are people who previously made a free Wix site, or bought some crappy companies $300 WordPress job. After 6 months or a year, they realize they&#8217;re missing out and it&#8217;s <strong>costing them money</strong>. So they decide to find a company who can create a worthwhile product that suits their needs. And <strong>that</strong> is where we come in.</p>

<p>If this post is to accomplish anything, it should be convincing you to charge what you&#8217;re worth and never back down. If you love your work, stay up to date in your industry, practice usability and write elegant code. Don&#8217;t even try to compete with some crappy Fast Food design firm.</p>
