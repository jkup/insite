<p>I mean it. Nobody, ever, wants to use Firefox&#8217;s inspect element instead of firebug. Let me be clear:</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/nobody_wants_firefox_inspect_element.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2532' title='nobody_wants_firefox_inspect_element' /></div>
<p>When Mozilla first announced the launch of their very own element inspector I thought they had just purchased Firebug and incorporated all of Firebug&#8217;s awesomeness into the browser. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>Additionally, when I first saw all the cool 3D rendering you could do of websites using Firefox&#8217;s cool new element inspector I thought that it was definitely the tool for me. Wrong again.</p>

<p>Take the iphone 5 for example. The new case, retina display and powerful a6 chip make it among the best phones in the world. But when I need my shirt washed or my jeans dried, it&#8217;s just not the device for me.</p>

<p>Firefox&#8217;s inspect element looks great, but it is in no way suitable for the common tasks that Firebug helps developers with everyday. I wouldn&#8217;t be so bothered by their new element inspector if it didn&#8217;t completely replace Firebug&#8217;s &#8216;Inspect Element&#8217; tab when you right click. Firebug has been demoted below and now reads &#8216;Inspect Element Using Firebug&#8217; which although clear, does me little good when I mistakenly click the inspect element tab above.</p>

<p>3D website are cool, but I have work to do.</p>

<h2 id='my_suggestion'>My Suggestion</h2>

<p>I think Firebug should be returned to its former spot and Firefox&#8217;s tool should go below it with a title like &#8216;Make this website 3D and poke around&#8217;</p>

<p>deal?</p>
