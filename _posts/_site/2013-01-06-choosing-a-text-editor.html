<p>Bet you weren&#8217;t expecting that, but it&#8217;s really the truth.</p>

<p>As programmers, we use text editors to write code. A good text editor will help you do that more powerfully and efficiently. The thing is, 90% of text editors on the market today do both of those things magnificently.</p>

<p>What really matters it that you identify the features you need in a modern text editor and then choose any of the dozens of editors that offer those features.</p>

<h2 id='must_have_features'>Must Have Features</h2>

<ol>
<li>File Browser</li>

<li>Syntax Highlighting</li>

<li>Automatic Indentation</li>

<li>Line Numbering</li>

<li>Search</li>

<li>Find and Replace</li>

<li>Fun Plugins</li>
</ol>

<p>This is what I&#8217;ve come up with so far as my must-haves. &#8216;Fun Plugins&#8217; is a bit vague but I just mean your editor should have a good developer community adding great features and keeping up with new ones.</p>

<h2 id='my_suggestions'>My Suggestions</h2>

<p>I think you should try as many editors as possible until you find one that just clicks with you. Also, I think trying a lot of editors is good because you never know when you&#8217;re going to find yourself in a situation that requires the use of a particular editor.</p>

<p>That being said, I think you should try:</p>

<ul>
<li>vim</li>

<li>emacs</li>

<li>Sublime Text 2</li>

<li>Netbeans</li>

<li>Gedit</li>

<li>TextMate</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='try_them_all'>Try Them All</h2>

<p>I find it quite enjoyable to play around with multiple editors. They each offer something unique and I think you&#8217;ll find yourself with multiple favorites.</p>

<p>Any other editor suggestions? Leave &#8216;em in the comments!</p>
