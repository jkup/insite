<p>Here&#8217;s the scenario. You&#8217;re getting ready to watch a movie. You sit down on your couch and pull your laptop over. You boot it up and pop in the DVD. Nothing happens.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s all too common with Linux Distributions. Bleeding edge distro&#8217;s like Ubuntu or the super stable packages like Slackware, sometimes for seemingly no reason a USB stick, CD, DVD or other device will just not register.</p>

<h3 id='2_upgrade__update_and_your_computer_wont_start'><strong>2. Upgrade / Update And Your Computer Won&#8217;t Start</strong></h3>

<p>This is the first and foremost reason I cannot take Linux distributions seriously.  This is also the reason I&#8217;m writing this post. I&#8217;ve had Ubuntu installed on one of my desktops for 2 years. Today ( 11/5/2011 ) I decided the servers were probably open enough to upgrade my installation to 11.10. I set it all in motion and let it do its thing. When it was done updating, just as usual, it required a reboot so I hit restart. It hasn&#8217;t booted since.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried safe mode, memory testing, dpckg, fdsk and everything else I could think of to figure out what&#8217;s wrong and nothing works. That is something that would <strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>never</span></strong> happen with Windows or Mac.</p>

<p>This is also extremely annoying although I know the blame lies with both parties. I <strong>hate</strong> that I can&#8217;t watch my Netflix movies on a Linux machine. I hate that I can&#8217;t access most College websites or use a lot of my favorite online applications.</p>

<h3 id='4_never_have_the_right_codec_driver_libraries_or_dependencies'><strong>4. Never Have The Right Codec, Driver, Libraries Or Dependencies</strong></h3>

<p>This is just super annoying. When I install some vanilla, ultra-lightweight Linux distribution, not having all the right software is par for the course. However, when I install a 700 MB Ubuntu install, and it can&#8217;t play movies that makes me furious.</p>

<p>This problem is also two fold. I&#8217;ve run into semi-similar issues on Windows and Mac, but those operating systems always point you in the right direction. Most Linux distributions won&#8217;t even tell you what specifically you&#8217;re missing. Let alone show you how to get it.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the real kicker. Not only <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>will</span> all of the above things go wrong at some point in time, but they will take <strong>ages</strong> to fix. Most solutions go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>1-2 hours searching forums, posting on message boards and chat rooms until you isolate the problem.</li>

<li>1-2 hours figuring out the actual solution and how to do it with your distro / version.</li>

<li>1 hour implementing the changes, this involves a lot of finger crossing and prayer.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='conclusion'><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>

<p>Linux is an awesome operating system. I&#8217;ve been a user for years and there are <strong>so</strong>many things I just love about it. However, there are so many time when one of these problems comes up and I need to take a break from Linux and go back to my Mac or PC.</p>

<p>What Operating System do you all use? Tell me one thing you like about it and one thing you hate!</p>
