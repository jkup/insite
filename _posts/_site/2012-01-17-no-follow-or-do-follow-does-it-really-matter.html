<p>Back link building has been at the heart of SEO since the very beginning. It used to be that the more links you had pointing to your website the better you would do on the search engines.</p>

<p>Times certainly have changed, but how much?</p>

<p>It seems like these days the craze is finding <strong>DoFollow</strong>Â blogs to leave your link. For those of you that don&#8217;t know DoFollow means that search engines will follow the link back to your website or blog.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot on the matter lately and I&#8217;m torn between two schools of thought:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is best to leave your links on DoFollow websites, so that you get credit from the search engines.</li>

<li>It is best to leave your links on high traffic websites, even if the links are NoFollow.</li>
</ol>

<p>While DoFollow links are certainly better for improving your rankings in the search engine. The question becomes what is actually worth more? On one hand, DoFollow links boost your rankings with the Search Engines. On the other hand, leaving your link on high-traffic websites can get you high-quality, targeted visitors from genuine clickthroughs.</p>

<h2 id='a_simple_test'>A Simple Test</h2>

<p>I spent 30 days spending 1 hour per day leaving DoFollow links on a number of directories and blogs. It&#8217;s been a few months now and it seems as though the only real results I got were an increased Alexa rank and a slight bump to my position in the SERPS.</p>

<p>Then I spent 30 days leaving well thought out comments on high-traffic blogs regardless of whether or not they were NoFollow. I saw a tremendous increase in my traffic and recieved many comments / subscribers from this traffic.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although the test certainly has many flaws, I would say it&#8217;s better to leave your link on high-traffic websites in the hopes of getting genuine traffic to your website. Although NoFollow links may help boost your rankings, nothing is quite as valuable as targeted visitors.</p>
