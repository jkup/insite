<p><strong>Hey everyone!</strong></p>

<p>So, I keep pretty good track of my blog&#8217;s analytics. This gives me a pretty good idea of what browsers people are using on this site. However, with web browsers updating so regularly. I&#8217;m curious as to which one you&#8217;re currently using and why!</p>

<p>So&#8230; Either leave me a comment or cast your vote on the sidebar!</p>
