<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve started moving away from designing websites and begun developing them. Mainly, I&#8217;ve moved away from being focused on graphic design, CSS and JavaScript and started working heavily with PHP and MySQL.</p>

<p>Although PHP is a tool mainly associated with back-end development. I recently noticed how helpful it can be for organizing your code.</p>

<h2 id='the_big_idea'>The Big Idea</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple really.</p>

<ul>
<li>Take your big messy HTML file and break it up into smaller files ( header, sidebar, content, footer )</li>

<li>Rename all of these new files with the .php extension instead of .html</li>

<li>Read the following paragraph to see what to add to the top of each .php file</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='meet_php_include'>Meet PHP Include</h3>

<p>It looks a little somethin&#8217; like this:</p>
<pre rel='PHP' class='prettyprint'><code>
  &lt;?php include 'path/to/your/file.php'; ?>
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure if any of you will find this useful. But I&#8217;ve been breaking my websites up into separate files lately and it makes things a lot easier.</p>
