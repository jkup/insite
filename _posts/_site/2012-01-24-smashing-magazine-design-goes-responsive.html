<p>A while back I <a title='Responsive Web Design – Praised But Unused' href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/responsive-web-design-praised-but-unused/'>wrote a post</a> &#8216;calling out&#8217; popular web design blogs for singing the praises of responsive design but not actually implementing it on their sites.</p>

<p>Today I noticed that <a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/'>Smashing Magazine</a> has re-designed with one of the most incredible designs I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>Smashing Magazine is a great resource despite the design. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with it ( you must be new or living under a rock ) but it&#8217;s the holy grail of web design sites. They have some of the best articles ever written and they sponsor almost all of my favorite blogs with their Smashing Network.</p>

<p>I really recommend going and checking out this design. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but I think it&#8217;s the greatest design I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The things I have noticed are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The UX is <strong>amazing</strong>. Everything is right where you think it should be.</li>

<li>The Degrade is flawless. Re-sizing the window from 1900+ pixels to 200 is one of the smoothest transitions I&#8217;ve seen.</li>

<li>The Buttons are fun to click. This is an effect that I always strive for, getting more CTR through buttons that your users <strong>want</strong> to click.</li>

<li>The comments are easy to read. Another tough accomplishment. Comments are often ugly and deemed not worth reading but Smashing Magazine&#8217;s design makes you want to read other people comments.</li>

<li>The fonts are awesome. I&#8217;ve been wanting to start using paid web font programs like <a href='https://typekit.com/'>TypeKit</a> for a while now, sometimes they are really worth the cost.</li>

<li>The content is top-notch. They always have amazing images and fantastic content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Am I over-reacting here; Or is this one of the greatest designs on the web?</p>
