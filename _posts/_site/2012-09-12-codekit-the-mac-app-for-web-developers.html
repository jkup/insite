<p>For one reason or another, and despite being a software developer, I rarely spend money on software.</p>

<p>After numerous <a href='http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/111-get-yourself-preprocessing-in-just-a-few-minutes/'>CSS-Tricks Screencasts</a>, I finally decided to purchase a license of <a href='http://incident57.com/codekit/'>CodeKit</a>.</p>

<h2 id='what_it_does'>What It Does</h2>

<p>This app has so many features, they include&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>It provides an easy and visual way for you to compile any pre-processed code like SASS or JADE.</li>

<li>It provides a brilliantly simple tool allowing you to losslessly compress your images.</li>

<li>It gives you live, animated browser reloads. Say goodbye to clicking refresh as you develop!</li>

<li>It allows you to easily combine and minify all of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>

<li>It integrates seamlessly with JSHint and JSLint for easy JS debugging.</li>

<li>And so much more!</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Just a quick disclaimer, I am no way affiliated with Codekit and they are not incentivisingÂ me to write this post. I genuinely think this is incredible software and that you should give it a try!</blockquote>
<p>I feel like a way better developer using it. Since I purchased a license I downloaded all of my images and ran them through Codekit&#8217;s one-click optimization. I losslessly reduced my total image size by 18%!</p>

<p>Since then I&#8217;ve felt free to really start experimenting with SASS and JADE and easily compressing all my code.</p>

<h2 id='what_it_costs'>What It Costs</h2>

<p>It retails for only $25! Plus it&#8217;s on a sliding scale so you can pay anywhere from $20-$28.</p>

<p>If I had one recommendation for the whole app it would be to increase the scale, $20-$100 seems like a better option.</p>

<p>So go grab it already!</p>
