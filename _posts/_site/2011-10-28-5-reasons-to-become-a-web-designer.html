<h2 id='1_its_creative'>1) It&#8217;s Creative</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the arts. One problem I always had is I&#8217;m terrible at drawing / painting. Web Design is a great field that allows me to be artistic and expressive without having to pick up a pencil. Web design is a financially viable career that allows you do create and design and every company needs at least one.</p>

<h2 id='2_its_a_much_needed_skill'>2) It&#8217;s A Much Needed Skill</h2>

<p>These days every company / individual needs a website. I wager it&#8217;s not long before everyone needs at least two websites. You&#8217;d have a pretty tough time finding someone that didn&#8217;t at least sort of want a website commissioned.  Whether it be a personal blog, e-commerce store or business page. Web design is in extremely high demand.</p>

<h2 id='3_its_quickly_evolving'>3) It&#8217;s Quickly Evolving</h2>

<p>Web design and the languages associated with it are evolving at an awesome pace. With the recent introduction of HTML5 and CSS3 it&#8217;s truly a great time to be in the industry. There are also many sub-fields forming in the industry. You can design websites for phones, or websites that provide great UX to increase conversions. There&#8217;s too  much for one person to master and more comes out every day.</p>

<h2 id='4_its_a_great_conversation_starter'>4) It&#8217;s A Great Conversation Starter</h2>

<p>Being a web designer means you&#8217;ll always have something to talk about when you meet new people. This relates to #2, wherein <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>everyone</span> needs a website. This means everyone you meet will want to at least figure out if you can help them with a web project they have in mind.</p>

<h2 id='5_you_can_start_any_business_you_want'>5) You Can Start Any Business You Want</h2>

<p>This is probably my favorite reason of them all. Being able to make awesome, professional quality websites means you can take any business idea you have, and give it a successful public face. Having a top-end website already puts you ahead of the competition in most business fields.
