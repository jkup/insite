<p>I&#8217;ve been a professional web developer for years now, and I&#8217;ve worked with just about every web host on the market. For the most part they&#8217;re relatively similar, but there are some things you should know before purchasing web hosting.</p>

<h2 id='the_different_types_of_web_hosting'>The Different Types Of Web Hosting</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Web Hosting -</strong>The most inexpensive plans. You pay for a shared spot on a web server.</li>

<li><strong>VPS Hosting -</strong>Moderately priced. You pay for a <em>Virtual Private Server</em>. Similar to a shared hosting plan except that you actually own a specific amount of hard drive space and memory.</li>

<li><strong>Dedicated Hosting -</strong>Expensive. This option is only for extremely high traffic websites and you get what you pay for.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of this article, we&#8217;re going to be talking about <strong>Shared Hosting</strong> plans. I figure that anyone with the need for a <strong>VPS</strong> or <strong>Dedicated Server</strong> probably knows the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of web hosts.</p>

<h3 id='1_domain_limits'>1. Domain Limits</h3>

<p>When you purchase a web hosting plan, the company you buy from is going to have its own set of rules regarding how many domains you&#8217;re allowed to host and how much additional domains cost. A <strong>bad</strong> web host will put a limit on how many domains you can host, or charge monthly for each domain after the first. A <strong>good</strong> web host will offer you unlimited domains to host at no extra charge.</p>

<p>Now, hosting multiple domains <strong>might</strong> not be that important to you right now. But really think about it. If you&#8217;re paying ( let&#8217;s say ) $5.00 per month for your own web hosting plan and you get an idea for a new website. Do you really want to have to sign up for another $5.00 per month just to host your new domain? It&#8217;s a really liberating feeling knowing that you can always add additional domains to your plan, so make sure you get yourself set up right from the beginning.</p>

<h3 id='2_mysql_databases'>2. MySQL Databases</h3>

<p>MySQL Databases are crucial for doing anything cool on the web. Without getting too technical, you can&#8217;t have a forum, blog, CMS, wiki, etc without creating a MySQL database. While most web hosts offer a small number of databases, this is another area where you would rather be safe than sorry. A <strong>good</strong> web host will give you unlimited MySQL Databases so you can try out as many fun web applications as your heart desires!</p>

<h3 id='3_customer_support'>3. Customer Support</h3>

<p>Especially if you&#8217;re new to owning your own website, you&#8217;re going to run into problems and you&#8217;re going to need to call customer support. Whether your website goes down, breaks, or isn&#8217;t allowing you to do something you want to do; Customer support is really important. One thing to watch out for is web hosts that don&#8217;t offer a phone number. Another handy trick is typing the name of your web host followed by words like <em>sucks, is terrible, is down into Google and seeing what blows back.</em></p>
