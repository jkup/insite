<p>I started off this week reading Luke Wroblewski&#8217;s <em>Mobile First</em><em>.</em>**</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><a href='http://www.abookapart.com/products/mobile-first'><img src='/images/mobile_first.jpeg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2356' title='mobile_first' /></a></div>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read it already, you really should; It&#8217;s an incredible read.</p>

<p>Anyway, Luke got me thinking about so much. Mobile technology, native apps vs. mobile websites but what I found most interesting was his ideas of designing applications that make use of the new ways people use mobile devices. I&#8217;m talking about swiping, tapping, tilting websites.</p>

<p>Today, I stumbled across <a href='http://www.damienelsing.com/'>Damien Elsing's Blog</a> and noticed something strange on his sidebar:</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/voice_message.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2358' title='voice_message' /></div>
<p>Check that out, on the right side there is a tooltip asking you to leave an audio message as feedback on his blog.</p>

<p>My immediate reaction was that asking for audio feedback is a bad idea. Thinking about recording a message on Damien&#8217;s blog seemed like an awkward experience. It also filled my with questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the experience going to be like?</li>

<li>Will I have a chance to listen to my message before I send it?</li>

<li>Who&#8217;s going to be listening to this message?</li>

<li>How many blog readers are properly set up to leave an audio message?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='the_reality'>The Reality</h3>

<p>Curiosity got the best of me and I clicked the leave feedback button which answered a few of my questions. It seems like you can record before sending and the technology that Damien is using for audio recording is Adobe&#8217;s Flash Player.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m a bit too security conscious to give Adobe permissions to my mic and webcam so I didn&#8217;t leave a message. However just because we have barriers today doesn&#8217;t mean that audio comments are bust.</p>

<p>I think that if more blogs and websites started offering blogging comments it could be a really great means for 1 way communication. Text seems to be advantageous in that it can be read by everyone who stops through.</p>

<p>Any of you using audio on your websites? Care to share your experience?</p>
