<p>Up late, browsing Hacker News it dawns on me how much I have left to learn. About the web, development and design.</p>

<h2 id='nearly_two_years_ago'>Nearly Two Years Ago&#8230;</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s been almost two years since I landed my first web design internship. Knowing next-to-nothing about programming, the web or design - I was brought on board by a <a href='http://3.7designs.co/'>web company in my area</a> where I got a good education in the fundamentals of Web Development and Search Engine Optimization.</p>

<p>After leaving the internship I <a href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/'>started up my own company</a> doing freelance web design for clients on a budget. Right away I was having a blast and feeling on top of the world. I knew very little about the web but I was always able to hack projects together and figure out a <em>good </em><em>enough</em> solution. I was mostly installing pre-made themes with minor tweaks or creating website from Photoshop documents.</p>

<h2 id='six_months_in'>Six Months In&#8230;</h2>

<p>After surviving this way for a while, I began to understand the technologies I was using and became fascinated with learning as much as possible about them. I purchased a <a href='http://www.lynda.com/'>Lynda.com</a> account and started watching hours and hours of training videos every day. I ran into that old adage &#8220;The more you learn, the less you know&#8221;. As I began learning more about web servers, scripting languages, and web frameworks I couldn&#8217;t believe how much there was out there. There is a serious difference between learning how to create WordPress themes and becoming a serious web developer.</p>

<h2 id='about_a_year'>About A Year&#8230;</h2>

<p>I was a little over a year in the industry when I landed a paid internship at another <a href='http://wojodesign.com/'>great web design company</a> helping out with SEO and design. They had a serious client base and I got to work on a large variety of projects. They introduced me to version control, as well as a more advanced view on design and development. Leaving this internship I has a much clearer sense of what I wanted to accomplish. I wanted to be one of those developers with an incredible skill set and diverse portfolio. Since leaving I&#8217;ve begun taking my education a lot more seriously.</p>

<p>I re-enrolled in college and began taking a heavy load of computer science classes. I&#8217;ve expanded my blogroll to include dozens and dozens of design and development blogs. I&#8217;ve started reading aggregator websites like <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/'>Hacker News</a> daily and even become the co-organizer of a <a href='http://www.meetup.com/ann-arbor-php-mysql/'>local programming meetup group</a> in my hometown.</p>

<h2 id='back_to_the_future'>Back To The Future</h2>

<p>As I continue learning, the list of items on my &#8220;to learn&#8221; list continues to grow. There are so many technologies I have a rudimentary knowledge of that I seek mastery for. I think the important thing to remember is that the journey is the destination. I need to keep it in my head that my to learn list will never reach zero, and that&#8217;s part of what drew me to web development in the first place. New technologies are advancing at a pace that makes it extremely difficult to keep up, but the infrastructure of the industry is still built on concepts that have been around since the late 1970&#8217;s.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s to never stopping learning, and always being aware of what we don&#8217;t know.</p>
