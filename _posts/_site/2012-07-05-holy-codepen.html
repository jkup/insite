<p>It&#8217;s really self explanatory ( clearly made by front-end folks ) so I won&#8217;t bore you with a full report. However, here are my highlights:</p>

<li>Easily build pens with HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li>

<li>Include JS libraries like jQuery, MooTools and Prototype</li>

<li>Have your work seen by others, and share pens you think are awesome</li>
</ul>
