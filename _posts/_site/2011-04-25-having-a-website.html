<p>One of the most difficult things I find myself explaining to people is not to view your website ( or future website ) as a <strong>cost</strong> so much as an <strong>investment</strong>. It is important to view your website as a means to advertise, acquire new business, expand your market and increase sales.</p>

<h2 id='the_problem'>The Problem</h2>

<p>Often times people are looking to spend as little as possible on a website that will be &#8216;good enough&#8217;. I find that this almost always ends in disappointment. Most designers and developers don&#8217;t like working on budget projects. It makes them feel constricted and does not allow them to really produce something they can be proud of. On the other side, most clients end up disappointed with their websites. Furthermore, the client is left without ever knowing what &#8216;could have been&#8217;.</p>

<h2 id='the_solution'>The Solution</h2>

<p>I believe that the solution to this problem lies with designers, specifically with salespeople and project managers working for the design agency. It is their job to show prospective clients what websites can bring to a company without making them feel as though you are only after their money.</p>

<p>When attending your first meeting with a prospective client, it is important to accomplish two things. First, you should listen to your clients needs and budget and let them know whether or not you&#8217;ll be able to provide a solution for them. Second, you should present them with information, graphs, statistics and assistance to show them what a website can do for their company. It is important to do this gracefully, and approach this as a person who wants to help.</p>

<h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Web design projects are unlike many other services. While it <strong>is</strong> important to provide your clients with exactly what they are looking for, it is also <strong>your duty</strong> as an authority in the field to provide them with your ideas and insights for how you could help their company grow.</p>
