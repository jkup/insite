<p>Have Your WordPress Pages Disappeared?</p>

<p>This How-To is for people who have just moved a WordPress website from one server to another and have come to find that their posts and pages have disappeared. I just moved a full WordPress website from a Dreamhost account to a GoDaddy account and had this happen.</p>

<h2 id='what_to_do'>What To Do</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re having a similar experience and your WordPress pages have disappeared, try doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log In to the new WordPress Dashboard</li>

<li>Click Settings -&#62; Permalinks</li>

<li>Change the Permalink Structure back to Default</li>

<li>Check to see if your pages are back!</li>

<li><em>optional</em> If you&#8217;d like, you should be able to change your permalink structure back to whatever it is you desire</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>
