<p>So, I was clicking around <a href='http://distrowatch.com/'>Distrowatch</a> yesterday (March 29, 2012) when I saw something I could not believe. According to their Page Hit Ranking tool, <a href='http://linuxmint.com/'>Linux Mint</a> is getting twice the Hits Per Day that <a href='http://www.ubuntu.com/'>Ubuntu</a> receives. This means twice as many people are visiting the Linux Mint website than visit Ubuntu&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Check it out:</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/ubuntu_and_mint.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2114' title='ubuntu_and_mint' /></div>
<p>Now, before I go flying off the handle on a tangential rant, I do understand that twice as many Hits Per Day does not mean the distribution is <strong>more popular</strong>, just the website.</p>

<p>Even still, I could not believe this to be true. I mean, I&#8217;ve run a few Mint box&#8217;s before and been quite happy. It&#8217;s nothing against the distribution, I just didn&#8217;t think <strong>any</strong> other OS held a candle to Ubuntu&#8217;s popularity.</p>

<h2 id='ubuntu_vs_mint__a_dataless_analysis'>Ubuntu vs. Mint - A Dataless Analysis</h2>

<p>Since I can&#8217;t find any data on how many times Mint or Ubuntu have been downloaded, I&#8217;ve devised a few other ways to compare the distributions popularity. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come up with:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Website&#8217;s Compete Rank</li>

<li>Active Forum Members</li>

<li>Number of People In Each Distribution&#8217;s IRC Channel</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='ubuntu_vs_mint__compete_rank'>Ubuntu vs. Mint - Compete Rank</h3>

<p><strong>Winner - Ubuntu</strong></p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/compete_ubuntu_vs_mint.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2121' title='compete_ubuntu_vs_mint' /></div>
<p>According to Compete &#8211; which isn&#8217;t completely accurate &#8211; Ubuntu is getting a good 18,000+ more unique hits per month than Linux Mint. I still find it surprising how close the two websites rank, but this is more along the lines of what I was expecting. Although you can see that Ubuntu is down significantly from last year whereas Linux Mint is on a big rise.</p>

<h3 id='ubuntu_vs_mint__forum_members'>Ubuntu vs. Mint - Forum Members</h3>

<p><strong>Winner - Ubuntu</strong></p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/ubuntu_vs_mint_forums.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2126' title='ubuntu_vs_mint_forums' /></div>
<p>Again, about what I expected. Ubuntu currently stands at just over <strong>1.5 million</strong> forum members, with Linux Mint barely over <strong>50 thousand</strong>.</p>

<h3 id='ubuntu_vs_mint__irc_members'>Ubuntu vs. Mint - IRC Members</h3>

<p><strong>Winner - Ubuntu</strong></p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/ubuntu_vs_mint_irc.jpg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2129' title='ubuntu_vs_mint_irc' /></div>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s certainly not proof. However Ubuntu&#8217;s <strong>1600+</strong>IRC members certainly dwarfs Linux Mint&#8217;s <strong>175</strong>.</p>

<h2 id='ubuntu_and_mint__final_thoughts'>Ubuntu and Mint - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I know nothing here serves as true proof. But the numbers definitely make me wonder if Linux Mint can possibly be getting twice the amount of traffic that Ubuntu is getting. As I was writing this post I was thinking a lot about if Mint really were passing Ubuntu, what the reason would be.</p>

<p>People don&#8217;t like change.</p>

<p>Well, they do &#8211; but people are initially resistant to change.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, Ubuntu has really begun to differentiate itself from other Linux distributions. They created their own window manager with the Unity interface and are soon to replace the X window system.</p>

<p>Perhaps there has been a growing number of people pushing back to more <em>standard</em> linux distributions like Mint as Ubuntu rolls out change after change.</p>
