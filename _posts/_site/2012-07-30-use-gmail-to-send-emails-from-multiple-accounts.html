<p>Gmail can be easily configured to send emails from multiple accounts. One of the best uses for this is if you have forward only email accounts, say from a website you own and you want to be able to send email from that account to. This requires you already have the other account forwarding to your Gmail account. At the end you&#8217;ll end up with something like this:</p>

<h3 id='so_heres_how_its_done'>Â So, here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done</h3>

<ol>
<li>Click The Cog in the top right corner of Gmail.</li>

<li>Click Settings From the dropdown.</li>

<li>Click &#8216;Accounts and Imports&#8217; from the top navigation.</li>

<li>Click the link for Add another email address you own</li>

<li>Enter your name and the forwarding email address.</li>

<li>It&#8217;ll popup a screen asking for some auth code, you can just close that.</li>

<li>In the meantime, you should have received a confirmation email, click the link in the email and Gmail will automatically add that account.</li>

<li>Now, if all of that worked out, when you click Compose or Reply on an email, you should see a link for &#8216;change&#8217; next to the From email address. This will allow you to change the from field.</li>
