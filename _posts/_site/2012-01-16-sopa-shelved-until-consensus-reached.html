<p>I&#8217;m Â not usually big on using this blog to keep up with the current events or the latest news but I think SOPA merits the attention.</p>

<h3 id='internet_dwellers_can_all_rest_easy_today_sopa_has_been_shelved'>Internet Dwellers Can All Rest Easy Today, SOPA Has Been Shelved</h3>

<p>According to <a href='http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204167-sopa-shelved-until-consensus-is-found'>The Hill</a></p>
