<h2 id='1_it_looks_awful'><strong>1. It looks awful</strong></h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying you have to be a professional designer, but take a look around. Be honest with yourself, does your website have the look of a blog ready for success?</p>

<h2 id='2_youre_too_smart'><strong>2. You&#8217;re too smart</strong></h2>

<p>Just something to remember. If you&#8217;re an intelligent person, and you try to write really smart blog posts using fancy tech lingo and the like. Chances are most people aren&#8217;t going to be able to read your blog. Keep your language fun and easy to read in order to reach a larger audience.</p>

<h2 id='3_youre_too_new'><strong>3. You&#8217;re too new</strong></h2>

<p>How many posts have you honestly written? If you&#8217;ve had your blog for less than a year and written less than 100 posts you should write more and worry less.</p>

<h2 id='4_you_whine_too_much'><strong>4. You whine too much</strong></h2>

<p>Are you really projecting a voice that people want to hear? You should be up beat, happy, motivating. There&#8217;s nothing worse than reading a blog article with someone droning on about their problems.</p>

<h2 id='5_you_care_more_about_google_than_your_readers'><strong>5. You care more about Google than your readers</strong></h2>

<p>If you spend anywhere near as much time worrying about your keyword density or title tag optimization as you do reading and editing your article with your viewers in mind your blog is going to read like robotic nonsense.</p>
