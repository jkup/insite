<p>Alright, that might sound a bit silly at first but let&#8217;s dive in to the question.</p>

<h2 id='facts'>Facts<em>:</em></h2>

<ol>
<li>Akismet blocks an average of 10 million spam comments per day.</li>

<li>95% of bloggers wish they had more comments per post.</li>

<li>80% of legitimate blog comments add nothing to the article.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Most of which have been made up on the spot for your entertainment</em></p>

<h2 id='comments_on_my_blog'>Comments On My Blog</h2>

<p>When I first started the <a href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/blog'>Insite Design Lab Blog</a> I was <em>obsessed</em> with getting comments on my blog.</p>

<p>I began blogging because I was inspired by blogging giants like <a href='http://www.css-tricks.com'>Chris Coyier</a> and <a href='http://www.problogger.net'>Darren Rowse</a>. These blogging icons often pull more than 100 comments on a good post.</p>

<p>Needless to say, when I first installed WordPress and started blogging, I was expecting to get at least a few comments per post. Boy was I wrong.</p>

<p>I spent months and months desperately searching for new and creative ways to  get more comments per post on my blog.</p>

<p>Even still, I get <strong>so much</strong> excitement out of each and every legitimate comment left on my blog. ( So leave me some! )</p>

<h2 id='the_reality_of_comments'>The Reality Of Comments</h2>

<p>Now, like I said, I genuinely appreciate every comment I get on my blog. However, lately I&#8217;ve begun to question what it is that makes comments so sought after for publishers.</p>

<p>Most comments left on most blogs are less than 25 words long and typically are of the following two schools of comments:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your post was good</li>

<li>Your post was <strong>not</strong> good</li>
</ol>

<p>While it&#8217;s totally endearing that a <strong>real</strong> person has read your article and taken time out of their day to leave you a comment, perhaps there are better metrics out there for monitoring your blog&#8217;s success.</p>

<h2 id='where_do_we_go_from_here'>Where Do We Go From Here</h2>

<p>For those of you that are publishers yourselves, how do you feel about comments on your blogs?</p>

<p>I suppose my question is two-fold.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are you obsessed with getting comments on your blog posts?</li>

<li>Do you honestly think your life would be made better if you disabled comments on your blog and just forgot about them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Leave me a comment :) and let me know how you feel!</p>
