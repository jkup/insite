<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a strange surge lately of spam comments that leave a back-link for Google, Bing or Yahoo. Those aren&#8217;t the typical sites you see in your spam comments folder. In addition to the strangely legitamate websites these spammers are commenting for I&#8217;ve noticed a crazy surge in the number of spam comments this blog gets. Typically it gets around 100 per day and today is well over 400.</p>

<p>I suppose I should also point out that the comments left by this particular brand of spammer are kind and full of pleasentries. I&#8217;ve seen my fair share of:</p>
<blockquote>Good Read. I was thinking of writing a post like this</blockquote>
<p>comments in the past but these take it to another level. One even went as far as to say:</p>
<blockquote>Posts like this brighten up my day. Thanks for taking the time...</blockquote>
<p>which makes it only a little less satisfying to hit that &#8216;Empty Spam&#8217; button and move on.</p>

<p>I did a bit of poking around and found <a href='http://www.warriorforum.com/adsense-ppc-seo-discussion-forum/448800-bing-com-google-com-yahoo-com-spam-comments.html'>this forum</a> thread claiming that these are just test comments that spammers leave to see if your blog auto approves:</p>

<p>but I still feel that if this were true so many people wouldn&#8217;t have just noticed such a sudden rush of them. I&#8217;m really not sure either way but it does seem like a strange new trend.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
