<p>As a blogger or publisher, you most likely are constantly tracking the number of RSS subscribers your blog has. Publishers tend to view RSS subscribers as a status symbol. The number of RSS subscribers you have should dictate how many people read your articles every time you publish a new one.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s common to see popular blogs with large groups of subscribers advertise them prominently.</p>

<p>As with Twitter followers and Facebook fans; Once you build up enough of a following, you can leverage your impressive numbers into credibility to gain more and more followers.</p>

<p>All too often however, publishers fixate on the number of subscribers without considering the experience that these subscribers or potential subscribers may have.</p>

<p>For subscribers, RSS feeds take on a different personality. Most readers don&#8217;t really care about how many other people have subscribed to your feed, they care about <strong>themselves.</strong></p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t mean to make readers out to be terrible, selfish individuals. Only to express the fact that most people viewing a blog are sitting at home or work, relatively alone and are looking for some type of <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>value</span>.</p>

<p>There are essentially two reasons people subscribe to a blog:</p>

<li>You are offering something they want in return for their subscription</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Case 1 - You Have Awesome Content And Don&#8217;t Need To Bribe Your Readers</strong></p>

<p>Just for the record &#8211; Vandelay Design is one of my favorite blogs on the internet. I&#8217;m not implying that they <strong>need</strong> to give bundles away in order to get subscribers. They just happen to be a prime example of providing real value to their subscribers.</p>
