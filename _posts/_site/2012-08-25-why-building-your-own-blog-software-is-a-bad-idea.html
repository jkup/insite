<p>Four weeks and a thousand lines of code later, I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that building custom blog software is just a bad idea.</p>

<h2 id='developing_a_blog'>Developing a Blog</h2>

<p>I recently started developing web applications for myself using PHP and a variety of great frameworks. This is what lead me to believe creating my own blog was a good idea.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using WordPress to blog since forever, and although I think it&#8217;s the best CMS currently in existence, there were just a few things I always wanted done differently and I thought I was up to the challenge.</p>

<h2 id='my_blog_idea'>My Blog Idea</h2>

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve become intrigued, maybe obsessed, with website performance. I really wanted to build a blog that was lighting fast. This meant a few goals for my project:</p>

<ul>
<li>As few HTTP requests as possible</li>

<li>Keep my MySQL queries down to a minimum</li>

<li>Use as few images as possible</li>

<li>Really tighten security, as I&#8217;m the only person using this software</li>
</ul>

<p>After a lot of consideration, I picked <a href='http://codeigniter.com/'>Codeigniter</a>Â as my framework for the project and got to work. I build the basics in a night and was feeling pretty good about everything. I had a great login system, the ability to create and edit posts and it was lighting fast!</p>

<h2 id='issues_issues_and_more_issues'>Issues, issues and more issues</h2>

<p>It was at this point that I discovered a new appreciation for WordPress. I ran into a few problems I just couldn&#8217;t solve:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pretty Permalinks - I really need to work on my Regex skills. I just could not get this working properly</li>

<li>A good editor. I tried CKEditor and TinyMCE but neither of them even came close to WordPress&#8217; custom TinyMCE theme</li>

<li>RSS. I really took advantage of WordPress automatically publishing an RSS feed. Building this functionality myself was tough</li>
</ul>

<p>At least for now, I&#8217;m back to WordPress with a new found appreciation. Any of you ever tried building your own CMS? Care to share your thoughts?</p>
