<h2 id='precursor'>Precursor</h2>

<p>Ok, so before I go into this tutorial I wanted to say that I am still learning the in&#8217;s and out&#8217;s of CSS and while I figured out how to get this effect to work, I&#8217;m still having some problems when trying to embellish upon it. That being said&#8230;</p>

<h2 id='the_idea'>The Idea</h2>

<p>So, often times I want a navigation bar or a featured post area that breaks out of the page wrap currently containing my site. Before now I&#8217;ve been just ending the page wrap, creating an element with absolute position and then starting the page wrap back up again. I know that could not be the best way of approaching this and a few days ago I found a method that works at least in some situations.</p>
<div class='button'><a href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/examples/extend.html'>Check out The Demo</a></div>
<h2 id='the_code'>The Code</h2>
<pre rel='CSS' class='prettyprint'><code> 
	#pagebreaker { 
		 background: #c9c9c9; 
		 padding: 30px; 
		 margin: 0 0 13px -10000px; 
		 padding: 30px 0 0 10000px; 
		 height: 200px; 
	} 
</code></pre>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple really, although I&#8217;m having problems trying to do much more with it. The basic idea is using a negative margin to push the element off screen to either side, and then use padding to bring it back to where it belongs, leaving the background color along the way.</p>
