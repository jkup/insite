<p>I love computer science.</p>

<p>I literally spend the majority of my waking hours developing software, reading about software development and learning how to get better at developing software.</p>

<h3 id='to_me_software_is_freedom'>To me, software is freedom.</h3>

<p>Knowing how to develop software is the modern day equivalent of being a real-estate agent, construction worker, electrician, plumber, salesman and CEO. What other skill set allows you to start to finish craft any business of your dreams?</p>

<p>The days of brick and mortar are long gone, websites and mobile applications are the future and there seems to be no end to the money one can make with a little business sense and a strong development toolkit.</p>

<p>Re-enrolling in college has been nothing short of an interesting experience. I&#8217;ve found a lot of my notions about <em>what college is like</em> held true and a surprising few have been completely shattered. Let&#8217;s just skip ahead to the real point of this article.</p>

<p>Most of my classes are in the Computer Science department. Class after class is taught by older men with Phd&#8217;s who seem to have lost all passion for the material they teach. They manage to make programming seem so boring people are literally walking out of my classes.</p>

<p>While we waste semester after semester building linked lists and terminal executing Java programs &#8211; real people are having a blast out their creating e-commerce stores, social networks and Software as a Service.</p>

<p>Now I know, College&#8217;s can&#8217;t be expected to change entire curriculums just because some hot new technology is being used on the web. I suppose my only point in all this is that it must take extreme apathy to make an industry like ours seem boring.</p>
