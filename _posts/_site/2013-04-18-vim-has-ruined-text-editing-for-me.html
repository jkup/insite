<p>Recently, I started working for <a href='http://www.barracudanetworks.com'>Barracuda Networks</a>.</p>

<p>I spend <em>a lot</em> of time in the terminal at work now, which is totally awesome.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been learning some great pro-tips lately and I think they&#8217;re worth a share!</p>

<h2 id='1_jump_to_the_beginning__end_of_the_line'>1. Jump To The Beginning / End of the Line</h2>

<p>Say you&#8217;ve got a long line in your terminal</p>
<pre><code>Username$: vim /path/to/a/super/long/file.txt</code></pre>
<p>Then you realize you mispelled something at the beginning of the line! No worry, just use</p>
<code>Ctrl + a</code>
<p>to jump to the beginning of the line and then you can just type</p>
<code>Ctrl + e</code>
<p>to jump back to the end!</p>

<h2 id='2_search_your_terminal_history'>2. Search Your Terminal History</h2>

<p>So often you&#8217;ll need to re-use a command that you used recently, or maybe you just can&#8217;t remember how a certain command goes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool that you can just type <code>history</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>Username$: history</code></pre>
<p>in the terminal and it will give you a list of the last commands you used.</p>

<p>Way cooler, however, is the interactive, fuzzy search through your history by hitting</p>
<code>Ctrl + r</code>
<p>Then just start typing something you need from your history and it&#8217;ll find it for you.</p>

<p>Some cool notes on <code>Ctrl + r</code> are that you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hit tab to bring the search result into your current line ( for editing )</li>

<li>Hit Ctrl + r again to find another appropriate selection</li>

<li>Hit Ctrl + Shift + r to go back if you pass the result you want</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='3_escape_period'>3. Escape Period</h2>

<p>Ever find yourself needing to type in the same long string twice? Maybe a file path or a long program name?</p>

<p>Commonly I find myself doing something like this:</p>
<pre><code>vim ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine the time I waste typing <code>~/.bashrc</code> twice!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a cool trick. At anytime in your terminal hit <code>Esc + .</code> ( that&#8217;s escape period ) and it will automatically paste in the last string you typed. It&#8217;s not 100% accurate but it&#8217;s pretty great!</p>

<h2 id='4_multiplex_like_a_g'>4. Multiplex Like a G&#8482;</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re a terminal champion &#8211; eventually you will run out of screen space. I tried to make it work for a while but eventually you need more than will fit on 2 ( or 3 ) screens!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s the solution?</p>

<p>Have tons of terminals inside each terminal!</p>

<p>Terminal Multiplexers, namely Screen and Tmux, allow you to have a bunch of terminal sessions inside one terminal ( think internal tabs ) and navigate between them with ease.</p>

<p>Both Screen and Tmux are pretty sweet, but screen hasn&#8217;t been supported in forever so just save yourself some pain and go with tmux. I&#8217;m going to write a tmux post soon with install instructions and some basic usage but just know it&#8217;s sweet for now!</p>

<h2 id='use_the_amazing_tools_in_front_of_you'>Use the Amazing Tools in Front of You</h2>

<p>Last thing. If you&#8217;re using the terminal a lot, you should really check out all of the amazing tools sitting in front of you &#8211; they&#8217;ll make your life way better! I recommend reading about and regularly using:</p>

<ul>
<li>Grep</li>

<li>Htop</li>

<li>Ack</li>

<li>Ps</li>

<li>SSH</li>

<li>Scp</li>
</ul>

<p>Just look them up with a quick &#8216;man grep&#8217; and start living better!</p>
