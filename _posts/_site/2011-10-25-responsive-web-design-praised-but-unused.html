<p>Responsive web design is no doubt a hot topic for today&#8217;s web designers. For those that aren&#8217;t familiar with the concept it involves using A <a href='http://960.gs/'>Fluid Grid</a>, <a href='http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/entry/fluid-images/'>Flexible Images</a> and <a href='http://webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-media-queries'>CSS3 Media Queries</a> to create websites that respond to screen size and adapt accordingly.</p>

<p>Shameless plug &#8211; Check out my new ( responsive ) <a href='http://www.jonkuperman.com'>personal website!</a></p>

<p>To simplify, this means that you ( the designer) can create websites that rearrange and re-size content based on screen size. So, on a large screen you may want a big full content area and a large ad-filled sidebar. Whereas on a cell phone, maybe you want to drop the sidebar and just have the content area fit to fill the screen. Well? It&#8217;s super do-able, check out those links!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking for information on creating responsive websites, the three links above will be a great start. This is, however, not that post. This post is more of a question to the web design community. If Responsive Design is so great, and makes experiencing your website much better, then why aren&#8217;t more people using it? More importantly, why are all of these blogs like <a href='http://www.alistapart.com/'>A List Apart</a> publishing books about how great the technology is, but not using it themselves?</p>

<h2 id='i_mostly_understand'>I Mostly Understand</h2>

<p>Now, I do get it. My website has &#62;100 visitors per day. If I want to re-design it&#8217;s really not a big deal. I can change the look and feel of the site and even a bit of downtime is not likely to affect anyone. I do understand that websites like A List Apart and Smashing Magazine don&#8217;t have this luxury. I also understand that a lot more goes into developing websites with custom applications and tens of thousands of pages, but I think there is still a small point to it all.</p>

<p>I suppose, to me, it seems the same as being lectured on how great American cars are by a race car driver that drives a Toyota. I mean, if they are really that great, and you really spend most of your time in your car / talking about web design than why aren&#8217;t you using it? I mean, what better way to support a new technology than adopting it, right?</p>

<h2 id='complete_hypocrisy'>Complete Hypocrisy</h2>

<p>I know, I know. Here I am talking about how much I love responsive design and how people shouldn&#8217;t talk it if they aren&#8217;t using it and I don&#8217;t have a single responsive element or media query on my whole page. It&#8217;s true.</p>

<p>But but, not to worry. I&#8217;m taking my own advice and will soon be launching a completely re-designed and responsive website! It should be live by November 10th, 2011.</p>

<p>That it all, does anyone actually read this thing?</p>
