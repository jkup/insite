<p>We&#8217;ve all seen ads on websites. They vary from extreme to subtle, from abrasive to barely noticeable but their existence is certainly a reality.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, why are websites using ads? How much money can you really make from them? And what are the drawbacks to having ads on your own website.</p>

<h2 id='why_use_ads'>Why Use Ads</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the answer is simple &#8211; website owners post ads on their pages to make money!  There are three main ways in which advertisements can bring you money as a publisher.</p>

<ol>
<li>Pay Per Click - You get paid a certain amount of money every time a visitor clicks on one of your ads</li>

<li>Pay Per Month - You get paid monthly to host each ad on your website</li>

<li>Affiliate Marketing - You advertise a product, and whenever someone uses your advertisement to purchase that product, you get a kickback.</li>
</ol>

<p>Honestly, they all have their pros and cons. It really depends on your audience. Pay Per Click can result in huge payouts, but only if you have a lot of traffic. On the other hand, if you have a small, loyal following; recommending products with Affiliate Marketing might be your best bet. Pay Per Month is the most steady payout, but typically you need to prove your worth as a website before people are willing to pay monthly.</p>

<h2 id='how_much_money_can_you_make_from_ads'>How Much Money Can You Make From Ads</h2>

<p><strong>$0.00 - $1,000,000,000</strong></p>

<p>Seriously though, this question can&#8217;t be answered easily. How much traffic to you get? If your website isn&#8217;t very popular, you can count on only making small profits at first. However, there are a lot of success stories where people make easy livings ( $50,000+ ) off their own blogs. So making money is definitely a possibility if you are willing to put the work in.</p>

<h2 id='what_are_the_drawbacks'>What Are The Drawbacks</h2>

<p>The main drawback in hosting ads on your website is losing visitors. This problem is two-fold:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ads rarely look good, many people leave sites with too many ads on them.</li>

<li>The only reason publishers can get paid for hosting ads is if people click on them. If people click on your ads, that means they leave your website.</li>
</ul>

<p>An example of my least favorite type of advertising, on one of my <strong>favorite</strong> websites!</p>

<p>The idea being that you put your advertisement between the title and content on your blog posts. It is supposed to be the most effective place to put ads but at what cost?</p>

<p>I understand that an awesome looking site like the one above needs to make income, and therefore they need to have ads. What I don&#8217;t understand is placing ads in a spot where people will click away before reading your article. It just seems silly to me.</p>
