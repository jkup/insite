<p>Are you looking to add google analytics to your self hosted WordPress website? This tutorial will show you how. Google Analytics is a great way to analyze your traffic and WordPress makes it easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. Sign Up For Google Analytics</strong> Head on over to <a href='http://www.google.com/analytics/'>http://www.google.com/analytics/</a> and sign up for a free account. If you already have a Google account, all you need to do is click the &#8216;Access Analytics&#8217; button and sign in.</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/sign_up_for_google_analytics.jpg' alt='Sign Up Screen For Google Analytics' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1199' title='sign_up_for_google_analytics' /></div>
<p><strong>Step 2. Sign Up Your Website</strong> After Signing up for your Google Analytics account. Click the <em>+ Add New Profile</em> link and fill out your domain information.</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/google_analytics_install_wordpress.jpg' alt='' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1245' title='google_analytics_install_wordpress' /></div>
<p><strong>Step 3. Grab The Code</strong> Now you&#8217;ll be taken to a screen where they give you a paragraph of JavaScript (don&#8217;t worry!) and tell you to paste it into your site. It should look something like this:</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/grab-google-analytics-code.jpg' alt='How To Install Google Analytics On WordPress' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1246' title='grab-google-analytics-code' /></div>
<p><strong>Step 4. Log Into Your WordPress Dashboard</strong></p>

<p>Now, head over to your WordPress dashboard. Go to www.mywebsite.com/wp-login.php and enter your username and password.</p>

<p>Now click:Appearance &#62;&#62; Editor</p>

<p>And look on the right sidebar for a file called <em>footer.php</em></p>

<p>click that and you should see something like this:</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/edit-the-wordpress-footer-google-analytics.jpg' alt='' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1248' title='edit-the-wordpress-footer-google-analytics' /></div>
<p>Now, yours will have different code inside, but you get the idea.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5. Paste That Code</strong></p>

<p>Now if you scroll to the bottom of this file you&#8217;ll see one of two things:</p>

<p>A comment that says something like <em>Don&#8217;t Forget About Analytics</em></p>

<p>Or, you&#8217;ll see at the end of the file&#60; /body&#62; &#60; /html&#62;</p>

<p>So you&#8217;ll either  paste the code where the comment is, or right before the body html tags. Just paste it in and click <strong>Save File.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 6. That&#8217;s it! You&#8217;re Done</strong></p>

<p>Now you&#8217;re all done, go back to your Google Analytics page and it should say something like <em>Gathering Data</em> (It might take up to a few hours to recognize you&#8217;ve entered the code.) Anyway, check back in a few hours and you should be all set tracking your website! Have fun!</p>
