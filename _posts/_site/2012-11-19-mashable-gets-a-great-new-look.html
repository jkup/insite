<p>Try as I might, I&#8217;m always against big design changes initially. Over the years I&#8217;ve learned to keep my feelings to myself for at least two weeks. Typically after a few days I find myself really enjoying a new design but initially I almost always find them off putting.</p>

<p>This time was different.</p>

<p>I really like this design. It really makes the most of my screen real estate and yet I have an easy time reading through the content.</p>

<p>One thing I really enjoy in a <em>news site </em>design is when they just get out of your way and give you the news. The logo is minimal, a nice fixed bar at the top has all the navigation you need; Other than that, you can just get down to business reading articles.</p>
