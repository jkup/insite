<h2 id='what_is_the_best_linux_distro'>What Is The Best Linux Distro</h2>

<p>This is one of the most over-asked questions on the internet today.</p>

<p>It usually merits some type of answer about how Linux distributions are very similar and <strong>you should pick the one that&#8217;s best for you</strong>.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s crap.</p>

<h3 id='if_you_need_to_ask'>If You Need To Ask&#8230;</h3>

<p>If you are on a message board or blog looking to get that question answered, you should go ahead and install Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I am a Linux addict. It&#8217;s my personal opinion that if Linux is meant for you, you&#8217;ll be an expert in no time no matter which distribution you decide to install first.</p>

<p>Ubuntu is the only distribution that&#8217;s made for complete newbies. I mean people that have never heard of bash, aren&#8217;t comfortable using a CLI, don&#8217;t care about package managers or dependency issues.</p>

<p>I think we ( &#8216;nix users ) all too often forget what it&#8217;s like to be an actual first-timer. Ubuntu has a great website, easy GUI installer, tons of support forums and channels and the biggest user base. It comes with a ton of additional software but that will make Windows user&#8217;s feel right at home. I love Ubuntu and I think it&#8217;s an ideal distribution for most users.</p>

<p>Programmers are elitists, that&#8217;s just a fact. Here are some common arguments against Ubuntu refuted.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu Is Slow And Bloated</strong></p>

<p>Seriously? Buy a better computer.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu&#8217;s Package Manager Automatically Grabs Dependencies</strong></p>

<p>Most people don&#8217;t have time to waste reading every single dependency for Aisleriot Solitaire. Automate it, that&#8217;s what computers are for.</p>

<p><strong>The Community sucks because blah blah</strong></p>

<p>The Ubuntu community is huge, not finding help on a particular site / forum / chat-room? Try another one.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;m Too Advanced And Need To Be In More Control</strong></p>

<p>Why are you searching for the best distribution? You should know your favorite. And why are you reading my blog?</p>

<h2 id='i_love_ubuntu'>I Love Ubuntu</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;d use Ubuntu as my web server OS, but for beginner&#8217;s / intermediates &#8211; it&#8217;s top dog.</p>
