<h2 id='insites_ipage_review'>Insite&#8217;s iPage Review</h2>

<p>In a word, <strong>terrible.</strong></p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, I cannot believe this company still exists. I&#8217;ve had three different interactions with them, one personal and two on the behalf of clients and in addition to appallingly terrible service, their business practices border on the illegal. However I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself, let&#8217;s start at the beginning.</p>

<h3 id='price_5_out_of_5'><strong>Price: 5 out of 5</strong></h3>

<p>I like to start all of my reviews with a positive note, so here it goes. As far as price goes, iPage is top-notch. Do not mistake me as saying they provide good value, but comparing the dollars per month you spend with iPage to another company almost guarantee&#8217;s iPage the win.</p>

<h3 id='control_panel_3_out_of_5'><strong>Control Panel: 3 out of 5</strong></h3>

<p>If you are a happy iPage client, there control panel is actually quite well organized and easy to use. The reason I docked two points is because they have one of those aggressive, sales influenced control panels in which they don&#8217;t allow you to do things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cancel your subscription</li>

<li>Remove a domain name</li>

<li>Get real assistance</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead, they try to redirect your attention to the positive. Showing you how many dollars worth of Google Adwords dollars and Security software you&#8217;ve gotten for free just for signing up.</p>

<h3 id='speed_1_out_of_5'><strong>Speed: 1 out of 5</strong></h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure why no one has written about this yet, but <strong>iPage is terribly slow</strong>. I know how shared hosting works and that sometimes you just get unlucky. This however, is completely unacceptable and can be reliably expected from this company. Of the three websites I&#8217;ve worked on hosted by iPage, the average page load time was 5 seconds. There are a lot of varying reports on <em>how long is too long</em> but they seem to agree that no one waits more than 3 seconds for a page to load.</p>

<h3 id='customer_service_0_out_of_5'><strong>Customer Service: 0 out of 5</strong></h3>

<p>I know this has been a pretty negative review so far, but this is where it really fell apart.</p>

<p>The first time I needed customer support from iPage was over the 5 second page loads. As with most hosts, they don&#8217;t provide a direct means to contact them, instead you have to fill out a support ticket. So I went through the motions and told them that the hosting package my client I bought was running way to slow and needed to be fixed.</p>

<p>They responded by telling me that there wasn&#8217;t anything wrong with the servers speed, and it <strong>must</strong> be something wrong with my internet connection. <strong>Big Mistake</strong></p>

<p>I politely responded by telling them that I didn&#8217;t like being lied to, attaching a Trace Route, Google page speed analysis, and speed tests from three different network connections.</p>

<p>After 4 identical conversations with their support team, it was clear I wasn&#8217;t going to be helped in any way. A few years ago, I would have been so outraged I would have started a month long battle, demanding to speak to a manager, etc etc.</p>

<p>However, I&#8217;ve lost a lot of my youthful rage and energy, so I just cancelled my account and moved to Dreamhost<em>.</em></p>

<p><em>Side note, dreamhost is an incredible hosting service, which I recommend. I&#8217;ll be reviewing them shortly.</em></p>

<h3 id='the_battle_is_over_or_is_it'><strong>The Battle Is Over&#8230; Or Is it?</strong></h3>

<p>About 10 months later, I receive an email from iPage saying that one of my domain names is still registered with them and will be renewed at the end of the month. I didn&#8217;t want this domain, so I logged back into my iPage account and set the domain to <em>manual renewal</em> to make sure my account didn&#8217;t get charged.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, I get the same email from iPage. I log back in to find my account has been changed back to automatic renewal and is scheduled to renew in a few weeks. I set it to manual again, and get a hold of iPage support telling them I don&#8217;t want the domain to renew. They tell me that it&#8217;s all set <em>not to renew</em> and I don&#8217;t have anything to worry about.</p>

<p>Another two weeks go by and I receive an email from iPage that they went ahead and charged my card for the domain renewal and it was declined. Luckily, I lost my card a few months back and had to get a new one. I got on their chat outraged and yelled at them for putting me through all of this. They told me that they weren&#8217;t sure what happened but that my account was officially cancelled and I didn&#8217;t have to worry about hearing from them again.</p>

<h2 id='summary'><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<p>Seriously don&#8217;t waste your time with this terrible hosting. If you want cheap hosting go with BlueHost, if you want amazing value go with Dreamhost and if you want incredible performance go with Media Temple.</p>
