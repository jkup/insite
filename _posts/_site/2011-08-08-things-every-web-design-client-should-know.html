<p>There are literally thousands of posts throughout the internet listing all of the important skills and knowledge every web designer should posess.  Although web design is a highly competitive industry and it is important that web designers gain as much experience as possible, I feel this trending topic often misleads clients into thinking that hiring a web designer marks the end of their contribution. Too often web sites are marketed as a product rather than a service, misleading <em>buyers</em> and setting the <em>designer-client</em> relationship up for conflict.</p>

<p>The following is a list of things I think every potential web design client should know before getting started with a project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content</li>

<li>User Base</li>

<li>Goals</li>

<li>Function</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='start_writing_your_content'>Start Writing Your Content</h2>

<p>I would say that at least 90% of websites serve the specific purpose of delivering content. Although funcitonality and design are incredibly important elements necessary for a website to succeed, the content is really what it&#8217;s all about. A common problem with web designer / client relations comes up when the client does not have content ready by the agreed upon launch date.  As someone looking for a new websites, you should really consider how many pages you want and what content should go on each page.</p>

<p>You should also do some checking on the web and look for other websites you like. Take a closer look at what makes them appealing to you or the industry. Try to find some sample pictures and content ideas and bring them to your first meeting. That way you can be sure you get what you want, and help streamline the design process.</p>

<h4 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h4>

<p>You should begin work on your content <strong>right away. </strong></p>

<h2 id='who_is_your_user_base'>Who Is Your User Base</h2>

<p>So vital to a website&#8217;s success, and yet so rarely discussed at length. It has been demonstrated time and again that you cannot market your product / business / website to <em>everyone.</em> As a business owner you need to spend time getting to know your target audience. As a web designer you need to get this information out of your client before you begin the design process. I find that it&#8217;s usually best to start the first client meeting by asking them a good amount of questions about their business. Most of the time I&#8217;m working directly with the business owner and often times they <strong>love</strong> talking to people about their business.  As a client you should take a while and think about the demographic your business typically deals with. You should really know as much as you can about them and how they interact with the web. For example if you cater to an older crowd, they probably won&#8217;t be impressed with big flashy techonlogy and might find it confusing.</p>

<h4 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Take time to understand your user base. Make sure the website&#8217;s design is catered to <strong>their needs.</strong></p>

<h2 id='what_are_your_goals'>What Are Your Goals</h2>

<p>Although goals are mostly associated with new websites, they are important to have throughout the life of your website. For a beginning website, goals may be a bit hard to acheive. There are many factors that limit the sucess of new websites such as the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_effect'>Google Sandbox Effect</a>, however without a set of goals it is too easy to allow your website to stagnate. If you have a blog you should set a goal for how frequently you&#8217;ll post new articles. If you are going to be marketing your site you should set traffic goals throughout the life of your website. When you have your first meeting with your designer you should run your goals by them and see if they think they&#8217;re achievable.</p>

<h4 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Set reasonable, acheivable goals for yourself and your website from <strong>day one.</strong></p>

<h2 id='how_will_it_function'>How Will It Function</h2>

<p>All too often designers get carried away with the <em>design side</em> of the process. It&#8217;s best practice to remind the designer or team you are working with what you really want from the website. How should it function, are you trying to&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>Sell a product</li>

<li>Create a following</li>

<li>Brand your company</li>

<li>Offer tools to your customers</li>
</ul>

<p>The design process should be heavily influenced by the websites desired functionality. Really think about what you want your users to do with your site. <strong>This fuctionality should be at the forefront of your mind during the design process.</strong></p>

<h4 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Always keep in mind what <strong>purpose you want your website to serve.</strong></p>
