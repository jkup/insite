<h2 id='what_is_timely'>What is Timely</h2>
<a href='http://www.timely.is'>Timely</a>
<p>Instead of posting your tweets directly to Twitter, you can (after signing up) start scheduling them on Timely. After you&#8217;ve posted a few tweet via Timely&#8217;s interface, their software will start analyzing the impact of each tweet in hopes of finding the most ideal times during the day to reach your followers.</p>

<p>Timely, and services like it are really great for a few reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you&#8217;re like me and do a lot of your article reading / sharing at one point during the day, Timely is a great way to spread them out.</li>

<li>Timely allows you to see some data about your tweets. How many people saw it, favorited it, re-tweeted it. Tools like that help you better understand your followers.</li>

<li>Timely&#8217;s main goal seems to work. It was able to find times throughout the day that seemed to get me a better impact on my tweets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='going_paid_all_wrong'>Going Paid All Wrong</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a big fan of Timely for the past year. The service seems to go down pretty often, but being a free service I&#8217;ve had no real complaints.</p>

<p>When I first got the email about their service going premium, I was hoping for one of three things.</p>

<ol>
<li>I would be grandfathered in as a free user, since I&#8217;ve been using the software for so long.</li>

<li>I would have to start paying, but it would be a reasonable rate.</li>

<li>I would have to pay an unreasonable rate, but since the software was now premium, there would be some great new tools to explore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, none of these things happened.</p>

<h2 id='what_timely_is_worth_to_me'>What Timely Is Worth To Me</h2>

<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t make any money with my Twitter account. I understand that many people using such software probably make money from tweeting, at least indirectly.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t make any money from my blog, and I only use Twitter to promote my blog - so I don&#8217;t really have much to gain.</p>

<p>I do, however, pay for some services for my blog. I use <a href='https://typekit.com/'>Typekit</a>Â for sweet fonts, and I happily pay the $25 per year for their great service. Like Typekit, I&#8217;d happily pay approximately $25 per year to have my tweets nicely scheduled.</p>

<p>So, how much is Timely going to charge?</p>

<p><strong>$10 per month</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, $10 each month just to add some functionality to a great free service (Twitter)? I just can&#8217;t justify that cost. Are they going to release any new, great features? It doesn&#8217;t seem like it. What about some benefit for using their service for two years? Nada.</p>

<h2 id='goodbye_timely_hello_buffer'>Goodbye Timely, Hello Buffer</h2>

<p>After a quick Google search, I stumbled upon <a href='http://bufferapp.com/'>Buffer</a>.</p>

<p>Buffer is freakin&#8217; awesome!</p>

<p>It does the same things Timely does - but Buffer supports Facebook, LinkedIn and app.net as well. It also comes with a better Dashboard, full analytics, browser plugins and more!</p>

<p>After playing around with the Dashboard a bit I was sold. I decided to get the Chrome plugin and check it out. Like Timely, it offers a quick button for posting the story you&#8217;re reading to Twitter. Unlike Timely, it has all sorts of awesome suprises.</p>

<p>I love <a href='http://news.ycombinator.com/'>Hacker News</a> - Check out this little gem!</p>

<p>I keep finding great little things like this. I really think Buffer offers a superior service.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s free!</p>
