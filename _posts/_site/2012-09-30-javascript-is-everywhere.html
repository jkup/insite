<p>Today, I began what I hope will be a long lasting relationship with <a href='http://nodejs.org/'>Node.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id='epiphany_strikes'>Epiphany Strikes</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was listening to a <a href='http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/031-with-matt-mullenweg/'>podcast featuring Matt Mullenweg</a> - founder of WordPress. The topic of most interesting programming languages came up and Matt started talking about JavaScript.</p>

<p>After listening to the podcast I looked into what cool and interesting things were being done with JavaScript and boy did I find a lot.</p>

<h2 id='javascript_in_the_browser'>JavaScript in the Browser</h2>

<p>Chances are if you&#8217;re familiar with JavaScript, you know it in the browser. With the help of libraries like <a href='http://jquery.com/'>jQuery</a> and <a href='http://mootools.net/'>MooTools</a> JavaScript is the language of interaction on the web. With it you can make animations, video games and even <a href='http://simplecartjs.org/'>shopping carts</a> .</p>

<p>This alone makes JavaScript a pretty fantastic language but I was really surprised to find its less common uses.</p>

<h2 id='javascript_on_the_server'> JavaScript on the Server</h2>

<p>Until now(ish), JavaScript has been thought of as an exclusively front-end, browser-based technology. With the introduction of node.js you can run JavaScript as your server side language. This offers a whole lot of functionality I&#8217;m not nearly adept enough to understand.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent the better part of a day playing around with node.js and it&#8217;s really changing the way I think about development. Here are  a few quick notes - I hope to post a lot more about it later.</p>

<ol>
<li>It comes with the Node Package Manager(NPM) It allows you to easily grab modules(helpers and plugins) and seamlessly keep them organized and up to date.</li>

<li>By necessity you control a lot more out of the box. It isn&#8217;t a simple scripting language so you can&#8217;t just have a single line of code. You need to use the http client and set some parameters in order to get started.</li>

<li>You can run separate scripts as either web based or inside the terminal. I&#8217;ve actually been using node.js to make some simple linux helper scripts.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='javascript_controlling_robots'>JavaScript Controlling Robots</h2>

<p>This was the final kicker for me. People are <a href='http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-arduino-programming-with-nodejs/'>using JavaScript to control robotics like Arduino boards</a>. I&#8217;ve seen some pretty cool stuff like one guy built a tweet notifier and others are making programmable arms.</p>

<h2 id='javascript_is_everywhere'>JavaScript IS Everywhere</h2>

<p>I think the moral to the story is that JavaScript has a good chance of being the language of the future. It&#8217;s widely supported, well documented and can be used for just about anything.</p>

<p>I feel comfortable saying that at the very least, <em>If you could only learn one language and wanted to pick the one that would give you the most bang for your buck - I would recommend JavaScript.</em></p>
