<p>Recently, CSS Frameworks have started to dominate the web. They are particularly useful, especially for start-ups that need a site built fast.</p>

<h2 id='what_are_css_frameworks'>What Are CSS Frameworks</h2>

<p>A CSS Framework is a stylesheet you can use to rapidly prototype your website. Essentially, they give you a bunch of classes and ID&#8217;s you can use that make your website look sweet. The two most popular CSS Frameworks on the market right now are <a href='http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/'>Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a href='http://foundation.zurb.com/'>Foundation</a>.</p>

<p>tl;dr I like Foundation better.</p>

<p>The folks over at Design Shack did a <a href='http://designshack.net/articles/css/framework-fight-zurb-foundation-vs-twitter-bootstrap/'>pretty nice comparison</a> that I agree with.</p>

<p>They are both nice looking, responsive and come with all the styles you should need for your project. I happen to like the buttons and typography that Foundation provides a bit better and I&#8217;m getting a little tired of seeing Bootstrap everywhere.</p>

<p>Normally I try hard not to hate things just because they are popular, but seeing the same buttons / forms / typography on dozens of websites each day gets me a little tired of them.</p>

<p>A while ago, I (think) I heard <a href='http://chriscoyier.net/'>Chris Coyier</a> talking about the potentials pros of having Twitter Bootstrap all over the place. He mentioned the usability gains for users that see the same CSS elements all over the place. I see some merit to that. I think users might enjoy seeing similar buttons and forms on many of the services they use.</p>
