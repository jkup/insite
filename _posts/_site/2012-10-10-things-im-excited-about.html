<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite sure if this merited a full blog post but I think it does.</p>

<p>Here is a list of things that have me excited, particularly pertaining to web design.</p>

<h2 id='1_firefox_web_developer_toolbar'>1. FireFox Web Developer Toolbar</h2>

<p>When FireFox released their own Inspect Element <a title='Nobody EVER Wants Firefox’s Inspect Element' href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/nobody-ever-wants-firefoxs-inspect-element/'>I was pretty disappointed</a>. It was a cool idea but it&#8217;s nowhere near as useful as Firebug.</p>

<p>Today, I updated FireFox and saw their brand new developer toolbar.</p>
<div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/firefox_developer_toolbar.jpeg' alt='' class='alignnone size-full wp-image-2570' title='firefox_developer_toolbar' /></div>
<p>I think they really nailed it with this one. It&#8217;s elegant, useful, fun and stays out of your way. If you&#8217;re a developer, go grab a FireFox update and check it out!</p>

<h2 id='2_bracketsio'>2. Brackets.io</h2>

<p>This is a project that I honestly passed right over without a second thought. A few weeks later, I came back to their website and can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t see the potential in the software.</p>

<p>The team here is providing a fun and elegant solution for programming the web, in the web. Browser based editors make a ton of sense and this one looks really promising.</p>

<h2 id='3_application_programing_interfaces'>3. Application Programing Interfaces</h2>

<p>Application Programming Interfaces or APIs are interfaces between two pieces of software.</p>

<p>Really what this means is that they are fun tools that allow you to get cool information from popular web services. For example, you can easily create a web page that lists all tweets that mention you, displays your last 10 Flickr images, shows your GitHub followers, etc.</p>

<p>There are so many possibilities using APIs that there are <a href='http://klout.com/'>entire companies</a> that offer services just off of other services APIs</p>
