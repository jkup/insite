<p>There have been a lot of great new things coming from <a href='http://www.hubspot.com/'>HubSpot </a>these past few months.</p>

<p>One of the biggest new changes is that they combine their Blog Grader, Website Grader and Twitter Grader into one all-inclusive and 100% free tool called <a href='http://marketing.grader.com/'>Marketing Grader</a>. As with all new things, it takes a bit of getting used to but I really think it&#8217;s an amazing upgrade. Plus, just in case you want the old services, they&#8217;re keeping them alive for now.</p>

<h2 id='no_more_alexa_rank'>No More Alexa Rank</h2>

<p>One of the biggest changes that seems to have gone un-noticed is that Marketing Grader no longer uses a websites <a href='http://www.alexa.com/'>Alexa</a> rank in determining their final grade.</p>

<p>It has instead been replaced with a <a href='http://compete.com/us/'>Compete</a> rank.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m <a title='Alexa Sucks and Here’s Why' href='http://www.insitedesignlab.com/alexa-sucks/'>not the biggest fan of Alexa's ranking service</a>, but I&#8217;m  not 100% behind the move to compete either. Let&#8217;s look at some pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id='alexa_pros'>Alexa Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everyone gets a rank</li>

<li>Easy to increase your ranking</li>

<li>Displays both worldwide and country-wide statistics</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='alexa_cons'>Alexa Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rankings are far from accurate</li>

<li>Only technology sites score well</li>

<li>Too much faith has been put in a websites Alexa rank</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all I think the Alexa service needs a lot of work before its rankings should be taken seriously.</p>

<h3 id='compete_pros'>Compete Pros</h3>

<ul>
<li>Highly accurate rankings</li>

<li>Easy to understand rating system</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='compete_cons'>Compete Cons</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only the top tier of websites <strong>actually get a rank</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#8217;m just going to leave that one con up there. I&#8217;d wager about 99% of websites don&#8217;t even merit a compete rank, making the addition to HubSpot&#8217;s grader utterly useless.</p>

<h2 id='alexa_or_compete'>Alexa Or Compete</h2>

<p>As much as it pains me to say, I think I would have rather HubSpot kept with Alexa&#8217;s unreliable ranking system. At least with Alexa websites can get some data to work with.</p>

<p>Do you use HubSpot&#8217;s great grading services?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
