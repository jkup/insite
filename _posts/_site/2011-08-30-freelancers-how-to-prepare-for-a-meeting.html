<h2 id='10_steps_for_freelancers_to_prepare_for_a_meeting'>10 steps for freelancers to prepare for a meeting</h2>

<p>When I first got started as a freelance web designer, meetings were the most nerve racking thing for me. Get me behind a computer with a text editor and a program to work on, I&#8217;m happy as can be. However, sitting down with a large group of new people and selling myself to them, well that&#8217;s a different story. So, I&#8217;ve compiled a list of ten easy to follow steps that will guarantee you more success in your future meetings with clients.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Make Sure A Meeting Is Necessary</strong>Often times, you should be able to touch based with and qualify a client over the phone or email. Before setting up a face to face with a potential client, go over a small checklist to make sure a meeting is really worth your time and that of your client. For my industry (web design), I like to make sure every potential client is ready to purchase a website, has sufficient funds to afford my services and that the person or people I&#8217;m going to be meeting with have the authority to make a final decision.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Do Your Research</strong>I like to learn as much as I can about a potential client and their industry before the first meeting. What type of business are they in? Who are their competitors? Who are their customers? What services do they offer? I even like to read a bit about the company history. It&#8217;s good to get a solid feel for who you are dealing with and what they might need from a website.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Know Your Client</strong>Every client or potential client has a different personality. To be a good salesperson, you should be able to customize your pitch around your client. You really should walk into a meeting blind and hope for the best. In the emails or phone calls prior to the meeting, try to ask a few prodding questions in order to get a better idea of what type of personality your client has. Also, you can do a quick Google search and see if your client is on Facebook, Linked-In, Twitter, etc. Take a few minutes and get a feel for their personality. Are they a no-time-to-waste, make it snappy type person? Or are they looking for a relationship, someone who will take things slowly and make them feel comfortable through the whole process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Arrive Early</strong>If the meeting is taking place at your clients office, this may prove difficult to do. However, if the meeting is at their office, it&#8217;s still a best practice to arrive a few minutes early. If the meeting is at a public place like a coffee house or bar, you should arrive at least 15 minutes early and make sure you are prepared. Pick out a table, order water for everyone attending and practice your sales pitch in the environment where it will actually take place.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Bring Nice Supplies</strong>Physical props make great sales tools. This is just a simple fact of the business. Spend a long time designing and creating your props and they will pay off in the long run. If you do this correctly, you can use the same props for every meeting and only make minor tweaks. For my business, web design, I like to have a nice laptop, high-definition print outs of some of my best work, a well designed and aesthetically pleasing contract, a nice leather folder to keep my supplies in, and a great pen! It&#8217;s a great tool and makes clients feel a lot more comfortable when you hand out supplies that look great and get information across efficiently.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Be Conversational</strong>Remember, your clients are there  to talk with you. They haven&#8217;t agreed to sit through an hour long presentation. Also, you have to understand that your clients needs truly matter. Yes, you are the expert in the field, but most of the time your clients <strong>do</strong> have a good idea of what they are looking for. I like to start my meetings off by asking the client questions about his / her business. This does two things for me. One, I get the conversation started in a field they are comfortable talking about. Two, I get to learn a lot about my clients company, their customers, their wants and needs without asking the questions directly.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Have An Agenda</strong>I know this may seem like it contradicts with <em>#6 Be Conversational</em> but it doesn&#8217;t have to! While it is important to keep the conversation flowing and feeling natural. It&#8217;s also a good idea to keep a bulleted list of agenda topics with you just to make sure you discuss everything that needs to be talked about.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Be Ready For Questions and Objections</strong>Any good salesperson relishes questions and objections. They are a great opportunity to show a client just how good your product or service is. In order to be a superstar in your meetings, take a good long while to think about and write down any questions or objections your client may have. Additionally, keep a running list of questions you&#8217;ve been asked in the past and how best to answer them. Don&#8217;t hope for the best, be prepared for reality.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Take Notes</strong>I think we&#8217;ve all been there before. You get done with a great client meeting and head back to the office. A few days later the client asks you a question and for the life of you, you can&#8217;t remember what they&#8217;re talking about. This will always come across as insulting and should never happen. Even during a fun, easy going meeting you should be diligently taking notes. If you have a hard time with this, bring someone else with you to the meeting, make sure you take good notes as it will help with all further interactions with that client in the future.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Always End With A Next Step</strong>Remember, it is your responsibility to outline the next step(s) with your client.  Whether the next step is signing the contract, filling out your online form, another meeting or sending a check! You need to be up front in letting the client know what you expect from them. I like to take ten minutes at the end of each meeting to go over in detail what I&#8217;m expecting from them and what they should be expecting from me. Additionally, as soon as I get home from the meeting I send the client(s) an email covering it all again just to make sure we are always on the same page.</p>
