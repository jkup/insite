<p>Before you write your next blog post &#8211; ask yourself this question:</p>
<blockquote>Has someone written a better version of this post?</blockquote>
<p>Chances are someone has. I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t write the post, just be aware that you aren&#8217;t a first mover on this topic, and people looking to learn more about your topic should probably check out the other article.</p>

<p>Just to make a point, I did this little exercise before writing this post and found that someone in fact had already <a href='http://teddziuba.com/2009/03/be-a-better-blogger-stop-readi.html'>written this post better</a> than I&#8217;m going to.</p>

<p>No matter what blogging strategy you follow, it is generally accepted that your blog should be <strong>worth reading</strong> in some way. So, if someone smarted or with better writing style has already written on your topic, either forget about it or construct a blog post that still has merit in the blogosphere despite your competition.</p>

<h2 id='blogarrhea'>Blogarrhea</h2>

<p>In the article linked to above, Ted Dziuba uses the term <em>Blogarrhea</em> to reference bloggers writing articles on information gained exclusively from other blogs. He then calls for a <em>Read More, Write Less</em> strategy to be incorporated by bloggers, I&#8217;ve taken this to heart.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m about a month and a half away from my 1 year blogging anniversary and I&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way. When I first starting writing articles, I &#8211; like many others &#8211; was absolutely obsessed with traffic, comments and social shares. I spent countless hours surfing the web looking for tips and tricks to get more people to my website. I tried link building, comment swapping and all the other blogging gimmicks.  However it wasn&#8217;t until reading Ted&#8217;s article that I never contemplated why readers <strong>would want</strong> to read my articles.</p>

<h2 id='a_simple_exercise'>A Simple Exercise</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re looking to make your blog more successful, here are a few questions you should contemplate &#8211; they might help you figure out why you&#8217;re not doing as well as you&#8217;d like.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t be shy, answer these questions honestly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you want more traffic? ( Monetize with advertisements? Get recognition? Make friends via comments? Build your resume? )</li>

<li>Why should people read your blog? ( Are you funny or controversial? A master in your industry? Do your articles save people time? Help people gain insight? )</li>

<li>How can people find your blog? ( Do you pay for advertising? Have you been around for a while? Do you leave quality comments on other blogs in your industry? Do you show up well on Google? )</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='books_vs_blogs'>Books vs. Blogs</h2>

<p>After thinking about those questions and coming up with some surprising answers, I decided to take a small hiatus from blogging. I took a break from both reading and writing articles for about a month, taking time to think about what I really wanted from my own blog.</p>

<p>I had just received some <a href='http://www.abookapart.com/'>amazing books </a>for Christmas and spent my extra timing reading through them. As I read through these great books, it dawned on me how much more information is packed into a published book than an ( average ) blog article. It isn&#8217;t that I think blog articles can&#8217;t be incredible learning tools &#8211; obviously they can. It&#8217;s all about averages, the average web design book is going to have more original thought and useful information than the average post. That&#8217;s how most of these people get published, they&#8217;re ( typically ) the best in the industry and have something worth saying.</p>

<h2 id='not_all_blogs_are_bad'>Not All Blogs Are Bad</h2>

<p>Reading books is better for your inspiration than reading blogs. It&#8217;s a simple truth that anything you learn through reading blogs has already been written on a blog. However, getting your inspiration from reading other blogs isn&#8217;t all bad. As important as original thought is, it&#8217;s also important for intelligent people to weigh in on current issues. If you are a real asset to your industry, you should stay current on the latest news and voice your opinions on anything contentious. I think I&#8217;m finding a nice balance with doing about 75% of my reading with books written by authorities in my field and 25% of my reading on popular blogs just to stay up to date.</p>

<h2 id='need_blog_inspiration'>Need Blog Inspiration?</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re suffering from writers block, my first recommendation is to not write. Wait until you have something that needs to be said, don&#8217;t blog just for the hell of it. However, I understand that some people don&#8217;t have that luxury. Maybe you have to write regular posts to keep your fans, boost your SEO ranking or maybe it&#8217;s your job. If this is the case I&#8217;ve found some pretty cool ways to get inspired without producing <strong>Blogarrhea.</strong>These ideas apply to web design / programming &#8211; my field &#8211; but I&#8217;m sure you can apply the basic idea to your field as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read a book, write a review.</li>

<li>Search Github for some not-well-known piece of software, write a tutorial.</li>

<li>Create something, then write about how awesome it is.</li>

<li>Take a look at forums and help sections, find an unanswered question and answer it with a blog post.</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>
