<p>As a member of the Web Design &#38; Search Engine Optimization industry, Alexa is one of my least favorite topics of discussion with clients. I pride myself on being a man who has the answers. I&#8217;m more than comfortable answering questions like:</p>
<blockquote>How can I get more traffic to my web site?</blockquote><blockquote>What can I do to improve my conversion rate?</blockquote><blockquote>Can you explain the different online advertising companies to me and tell me which one would be best for my business?</blockquote>
<p>But one of the few questions I just can&#8217;t answer is, <em>why is my Alexa rank so low?</em></p>

<p>The best answer I can come up with is, because <strong>Alexa Sucks</strong>.</p>

<h3 id='alexa_sucks_the_case_study'>Alexa Sucks, The Case Study</h3>

<p>I was recently hired by a Japanese toy store to run a social media campaign. Their store gets a good amount of traffic (<strong>3,500+ unique visitors per day</strong>) and their Alexa rank is terrible (<strong>1,042,039 at the time of this article</strong>). They were very concerned about their Alexa rank, apparently some of their potential investors wanted to justify the investment based on their rank alone.</p>

<p>I explained to them that at best <strong>Alexa provides a biased, incomplete, seemingly arbitrary review of most web sites, and that it&#8217;s ridiculous that any professional would give any credibility to a web site&#8217;s rank</strong>.</p>

<p>The conversation went over well and they decided to give up on the idea of improving their rank. That is, until we launched a small forum for their customers and with only 200 or less hits a day, the forum&#8217;s Alexa rank skyrocketed to <strong>500,000</strong>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s Review:</p>
<p style='text-align: center;'>**The Store, which gets 3,000+ unique hits per day**</p><div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/Alexa_sucks_GSAM.jpg' alt='' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028' title='Alexa_sucks_GSAM' /></div><p style='text-align: center;'>**The recently launched forum, which gets less than 200 unique hits per day**</p><div class='img-wrap'><img src='/images/Alexa_sucks_Gundam_forums.jpg' alt='' class='aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029' title='Alexa_sucks_Gundam_forums' /></div><p style='text-align: left;'>Granted, by necessity, Alexa is an imperfect service. However I think that it is inexcusably flawed and biased. Here is where Alexa is flawed beyond repair:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alexa gathers its data from people using the Alexa Toolbar. Who uses the Alexa toolbar? Web Developers, Administrators, Geeks like myself. This means that a website like mine with very little traffic can rank in the low 400,000&#8217;s while an extremely popular toy store like Gundam Store and More ranks over 1,000,000.</li>

<li>Although the majority of bloggers are based out of the United States, many (perhaps unreliable) statistics project that over 60% of Alexa Toolbar users are based in China. Is your web site catering to people in China? Mine sure isn&#8217;t.</li>

<li>No one uses the stupid toolbar. It doesn&#8217;t come pre-installed on any major browser, and the majority of the internet-surfing public doesn&#8217;t go out of their way to download addons. Especially one&#8217;s they can&#8217;t <em>use</em>Â for anything.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='why_does_it_matter_that_alexa_sucks'>Why Does It Matter That Alexa Sucks?</h3>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. As a company, Alexa is actually fairly innocent and doesn&#8217;t deserve much of the contempt I have. The <strong>real</strong> problem comes from third party applications using a web site&#8217;s Alexa rank as a reliable means to grade the web site. Companies like BuySellAds, WebsiteGrader, and (rumored) Google use the Alexa&#8217;s ranking system in their own algorithms to determine popularity.</p>

<p>So, the real problem is that other, important companies take Alexa&#8217;s ranking system as a reliable means to learn about a web site when it clearly is not.</p>

<h3 id='your_thoughts'>Your Thoughts</h3>

<p>I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts if any of you have had experiences with Alexa&#8217;s ranking system whether they&#8217;ve been good or bad. I&#8217;d like to update this post with a few more case studies and try to figure out if I&#8217;ve just had bad experiences or if there really is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p>
