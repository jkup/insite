title: Vim Has Ruined Text Editing For Me

I've been using vim as my full time code editor for about 4 months now.

It was not an easy journey but it was definitely worthwhile.

This is not a tutorial on how or why to use vim. If you're looking for something like that you should check out:

## Vim Makes Things Easy... Eventually

Starting out using vim is extremely difficult. Eventually though I began to realize that a lot of the things that were tough at first led to better ways to edit text.

I'm not going to get too specific but there are a few things that vim offers that I've come to expect whenever I'm editing text. I find myself getting more and more frustrated when I don't have these tools available and it's caused me to use vim for more and more of my non code editing.

## Things I Need

1. Jump to the beginning of a line with <code>&#94;</code>
2. Jump to the end of a line with <code>$</code>
3. Delete a word with <code>dw</code>
4. Delete text till the end of the line with <code>D</code>
5. Cut or Copy an entire line with <code>dd</code> or <code>yy</code>
6. Jump to the top of the page with <code>gg</code>
7. Jump to the end of the page with <code>G</code>
8. Repeat the last task you did with <code>.</code>

## My Solution

Lately I've been looking into vim plugins that make doing other text related tasks like email, blog posts and journaling better.

It seems like the easiest solution is just to use vim for everything.
