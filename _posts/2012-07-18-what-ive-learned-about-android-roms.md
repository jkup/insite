## Understanding Roms

I suppose the first thing I learned about Android Roms was what they were. Months ago when I first began tinkering with Android devices I had no idea what exactly a rom was.  According to <a href="http://www.ddsystems.com.au/other/android-2/android/">DD Systems</a>:

<pre>**Android ROM (or the ROM) **The Android ROM is the Android operating system.  This is the User interface (Sense UI in HTC phones) and the
file system for maintaining contacts etc.  It is composed of a Linux kernel and various add-ons to achieve specific
functionality.</pre>

So, basically a rom is an operating system. For those of you that are familiar with Linux this should make things click for you, but for others the concept of an operating system may still be a little abstract. Perhaps you've used Windows and Mac before.

This should give you an idea of how different operating systems can be. Really an operating system is just a layer of software that sits between your computer hardware and peripherals like your screen, mouse and keyboard.

Operating systems can be as different as you can imagine. They can be really lightweight ( think just a terminal on a screen ) or really beautiful. The point, for android roms is that they can be totally different but they are the software that allows you to interact with whatever device you're using.

Unlike regular apps, downloading and installing roms requires that you** root** your phone.

## Rooting

Again, for those lucky Linux users out there this concept should be easy to swallow. For those of you ( like 90+% ) that use Apple and Windows computers it may be a little more foreign.

The important thing to understand is that Linux systems ( including Android ) are multi-user systems. The 'root' user is the superuser, the one with the power to do anything including deleting system files and editing important files. It's easy to see how giving everybody superuser permissions could be a very bad idea. So for this reason, and to forever keep you from being able to delete that annoying NASCAR app you are locked out of this superuser ( root )role when you buy an Android phone or tablet.

When you look to download and install a rom on your device, it requires re-writing a lot of important system files which requires you be the root user ( rooted ) on your device. Becoming the superuser is different for every device so if you'd like to figure out how to root yours, turn to the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">XDA Developers Forum</a>.

Just a note as your interest is peaked about roms and rooting and all that good stuff. Remember that while there is a great community of people helping others experience freedom with their Android devices. You are about to embark on a journey that quickly passes what most warranties cover and many many MANY times lands you with a broken ( but fixable ) device. Just a note =)

## XDA Developers

XDA Developers is the mecca for Android development. It's a magical place full of information, great free software and underpaid, overworked developers who don't mind tearing you a new one if you don't abide by their rules. I say this partially in jest but it's a good thing to know. Most of the rom-makers and xda-developers are young students putting in countless hours of work for far less than minimum wage. Android roms have yet to be commercialized and there just isn't much money to be made in the industry. These developers are really passionate and intelligent but do keep their situation in mind when looking for help on a specific issue.

Anyway, Head over to XDA-Developers and check out their forums. Each supported android device has a separate sub-forum and within that sub-forum there will be a link for 'YOUR DEVICE - Android Development'. That's where you'll find all sorts of roms, themes, and instructions for installing them.

Keep in mind that understanding the inner-workings of XDA Developers takes a little bit of time. At first it may looks like a hot mess but after using it for about a year I really think it's the best way to keep such a community organized. My recommendation is to spend a good day or two reading through threads in your devices 'android development' forum. You'll start to understand how flashing a rom works and seeing what all is available for your device.

## Learn Your Device

Most Android devices are similar as far as how to flash roms and what's available. However some devices ( like my nook tablet ) come with their own special circumstances that make flashing new roms a little different.  You can easily figure out if your device has any quirks by reading through your devices thread on XDA. Once you're comfortable with your device, flashing roms will become second nature.

## Backup or Beware

When you flash a new rom, it will most likely delete all of the data on your phone ( not your SD card ). Your SD card will have all of your photos and videos on it but as for your applications, they will be removed. The two applications I use to back up my stuff to my SD card are:

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore&amp;hl=en">SMS Backup &amp; Restore</a>

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup&amp;hl=en">Titanium Backup</a>

## Flash Early Flash Often

Now that you're comfortable with your device and using XDA Developers to browse roms. You should have a nice honeymoon period. There was a time where I was flashing about 1 rom per day on average. Just experiment. They're all free and just about as easy to install so go crazy!
