Yesterday, I noticed that <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> has put up a small ad to educate people about the importance of stopping <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/SOPA">SOPA</a>.

While I don't want to get into too much detail, I thought that Craigslist took an interesting approach in explaining what SOPA is by informing you which companies were opponents and which ones were supporters.

## Opponents of SOPA:

Google, Yahoo, Wikipedia, craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, eBay, AOL, Mozilla, Reddit, Tumblr, Etsy, Zynga, EFF, ACLU, Human Rights Watch, Darrell Issa (R-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Ron Paul (R-TX)

## Supporters of SOPA:

RIAA, MPAA, News Corporation, VISA, Mastercard, Pfizer, Comcast, Time Warner, ABC, Nike, Walmart, Dow Chemical, Tiffany, Chanel, Rolex, Monster Cable, Teamsters, Lamar Smith (R-TX), John Conyers (D-MI)

### An Easy Decision

Really take a look at those lists and then decide where you want to stand on this issue. Do you want to be with Craigslist, Wikipedia or The News Corporations, Credit Card Companies and Walmart?

I hope that's an easy decision for you.

## Best SOPA Articles

There are already far too many SOPA educational websites out there and I don't intend on becoming another one. However, if you are looking to educate yourself, here are some great resources:
