I've been thinking a lot about pricing lately. One of my biggest disappointments is when clients don't have enough in the budget to purchase a design that would really benefit them. Whether it's design aethetics or great functionality, great websites aren't cheap and a budget under $1,000 is not reasonable.

Now, I'm sure many of you in the design industry have heard something like this:

<blockquote>*"I just need something simple, I'm not looking for a thousand dollar website, just something basic."*</blockquote>

But ask yourself this, do they really just need something basic? What is their site supposed to accomplish, and can it do so if it's poorly put together and doesn't meet modern day web standards?

Another point I should make before getting into this list is that it's worth noting the difference between **basic** and **minimal**. A quick example that comes to mind is Google's interface. Often mistaken as basic, it is in fact extremely complex in its elegance and a major with for User Experience.

Now to the list, here are the reasons websites should never cost less than $1,000

### **Websites Should Be Responsive.**

They should work well on every browser and type of device. In order to accomplish this you need to write media queries, use a flexible grid, do a lot of browser testing and perhaps even write multiple style sheets. These are important considerations for any website and take time to ensure they're working properly.

### **Websites Need Content Management Systems Or Frameworks**

Unless the people using the website are developers, every website should be built on a Content Management System or Framework that best suits their needs. Both the front and back end of the website should cater to their needs. It should be secure, easy to update and easy to maintain. This means no simple HTML &amp; CSS Designs, but designs that work around sometimes complex dynamic systems. This again takes longer and requires skill that go beyond the $1,000 price point.

### **Clients Need To Know How To Use Their Website**

We've all heard the following:

*"I don't need to know how to do anything with it, just leave it as it is."*

but we all know the phone call a few weeks later, wanting something added, deleted or changed on the site. The point is websites need to be fresh, they need to stay current. Things **are going** to happen that merit a change on the website, and your client needs to be able to make those changes easily.

Additionally, it should always be possible to add some type of web 2.0 functionality to your clients site. Adding a blog, forum or store to a site is common and you should make sure the site has the infrastructure to handle it.
### **Websites Should Be Future Proof**
I saw this term at HTML5 Boiler Plate and really liked it. When building websites they should support a practical amount of old technology while simultaneously preparing for new tech. All websites currently being built should be prepared for the changes we **know** are coming in programming languages and browser support.
### **Every Page Should Be Designed**
This point covers two of my pet peeves.

My first pet peeve is when you get to a site and find a spectacular landing page. But as soon as you go to move to the next page the entire design / structure falls apart. As a designer you should have been paid enough to make sure every page looks good and functions well.

My second pet peeve is when I go to a not so popular section of a website - for example a blog's archive page - and find it completely un-styled.  Although these pages may be considered *less important* you should never underestimate the effect your coherency falling apart has on your visitors.
### **We're way past budget now, huh?**
So there you have it, I think these things are absolutely necessary for **every** website and they demand a reasonable budget. If you don't have the budget for these things, you should question whether you really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> your own website, or whether something like a Facebook page would suffice.
