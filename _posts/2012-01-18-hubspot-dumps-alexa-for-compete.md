There have been a lot of great new things coming from <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot </a>these past few months.

One of the biggest new changes is that they combine their Blog Grader, Website Grader and Twitter Grader into one all-inclusive and 100% free tool called <a href="http://marketing.grader.com/">Marketing Grader</a>. As with all new things, it takes a bit of getting used to but I really think it's an amazing upgrade. Plus, just in case you want the old services, they're keeping them alive for now.

<p style="text-align: center;">**HubSpot's launched a new grader, Marketing Grader!** Try it out and grade your entire marketing funnel.
If you don't like shiny new things, go back to <a title="Go back to Website Grader" href="http://websitegrader.com/getareport">Website Grader</a>.</p>

## No More Alexa Rank

One of the biggest changes that seems to have gone un-noticed is that Marketing Grader no longer uses a websites <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a> rank in determining their final grade.

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1936" title="hubspot_dumps_alexa_for_compete" src="{{ site.url }}/images/hubspot_dumps_alexa_for_compete.jpg" alt="Hubspot Uses Compete Not Alexa" /></div>

It has instead been replaced with a <a href="http://compete.com/us/">Compete</a> rank.

## The Good And The Bad

It's no secret that I'm <a title="Alexa Sucks and Here’s Why" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/alexa-sucks/">not the biggest fan of Alexa's ranking service</a>, but I'm  not 100% behind the move to compete either. Let's look at some pros and cons.

### Alexa Pros

+ Everyone gets a rank
+ Easy to increase your ranking
+ Displays both worldwide and country-wide statistics

### Alexa Cons

+ Rankings are far from accurate
+ Only technology sites score well
+ Too much faith has been put in a websites Alexa rank

All in all I think the Alexa service needs a lot of work before its rankings should be taken seriously.

### Compete Pros

+ Highly accurate rankings
+ Easy to understand rating system

### Compete Cons

+ Only the top tier of websites **actually get a rank**

I'm just going to leave that one con up there. I'd wager about 99% of websites don't even merit a compete rank, making the addition to HubSpot's grader utterly useless.

## Alexa Or Compete

As much as it pains me to say, I think I would have rather HubSpot kept with Alexa's unreliable ranking system. At least with Alexa websites can get some data to work with.

Do you use HubSpot's great grading services?
