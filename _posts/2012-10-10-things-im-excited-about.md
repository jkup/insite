I wasn't quite sure if this merited a full blog post but I think it does.

Here is a list of things that have me excited, particularly pertaining to web design.

## 1. FireFox Web Developer Toolbar

When FireFox released their own Inspect Element <a title="Nobody EVER Wants Firefox’s Inspect Element" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/nobody-ever-wants-firefoxs-inspect-element/">I was pretty disappointed</a>. It was a cool idea but it's nowhere near as useful as Firebug.

Today, I updated FireFox and saw their brand new developer toolbar.

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2570" title="firefox_developer_toolbar" src="{{ site.url }}/images/firefox_developer_toolbar.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

I think they really nailed it with this one. It's elegant, useful, fun and stays out of your way. If you're a developer, go grab a FireFox update and check it out!

## 2. Brackets.io

This is a project that I honestly passed right over without a second thought. A few weeks later, I came back to their website and can't believe I didn't see the potential in the software.

The team here is providing a fun and elegant solution for programming the web, in the web. Browser based editors make a ton of sense and this one looks really promising.

## 3. Application Programing Interfaces

Application Programming Interfaces or APIs are interfaces between two pieces of software.

Really what this means is that they are fun tools that allow you to get cool information from popular web services. For example, you can easily create a web page that lists all tweets that mention you, displays your last 10 Flickr images, shows your GitHub followers, etc.

There are so many possibilities using APIs that there are <a href="http://klout.com/">entire companies</a> that offer services just off of other services APIs
