<blockquote>If Getting Comments Is So Important, Why Do Publishers Work So Hard To Combat Spam?</blockquote>

Alright, that might sound a bit silly at first but let's dive in to the question.

## Facts*:

1. Akismet blocks an average of 10 million spam comments per day.
2. 95% of bloggers wish they had more comments per post.
3. 80% of legitimate blog comments add nothing to the article.

*Most of which have been made up on the spot for your entertainment

## Comments On My Blog

When I first started the <a href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/blog">Insite Design Lab Blog</a> I was *obsessed* with getting comments on my blog.

I began blogging because I was inspired by blogging giants like <a href="http://www.css-tricks.com">Chris Coyier</a> and <a href="http://www.problogger.net">Darren Rowse</a>. These blogging icons often pull more than 100 comments on a good post.

Needless to say, when I first installed WordPress and started blogging, I was expecting to get at least a few comments per post. Boy was I wrong.

I spent months and months desperately searching for new and creative ways to  get more comments per post on my blog.

Even still, I get **so much** excitement out of each and every legitimate comment left on my blog. ( So leave me some! )

## The Reality Of Comments

Now, like I said, I genuinely appreciate every comment I get on my blog. However, lately I've begun to question what it is that makes comments so sought after for publishers.

Most comments left on most blogs are less than 25 words long and typically are of the following two schools of comments:

1. Your post was good
2. Your post was **not** good

While it's totally endearing that a **real** person has read your article and taken time out of their day to leave you a comment, perhaps there are better metrics out there for monitoring your blog's success.

## Where Do We Go From Here

For those of you that are publishers yourselves, how do you feel about comments on your blogs?

I suppose my question is two-fold.

1. Are you obsessed with getting comments on your blog posts?
2. Do you honestly think your life would be made better if you disabled comments on your blog and just forgot about them?

Leave me a comment :) and let me know how you feel!
