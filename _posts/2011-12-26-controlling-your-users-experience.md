According to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/quantify-user-experience/">SitePoint</a>, there are Four Elements Of User Experience.

While these four elements make up **The User Experience**, there is an important distinction to be made:

<blockquote>There is a difference between <span style="text-decoration: underline;">User Experience</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The User's Experience</span>.</blockquote>

Let's review.

**User Experience** is the way a person feels about using a product, system or service.

**The User's Experience** is the actual encounter a visitor has while using your product, system or service.

So, for the sake of this article, we're going to be talking about controlling the experience your users have while they are on your website.

All too often people just toss their content onto their website and let it land where it falls.

Let's take a look at a few things we can do to control the experience of your users.

### Option 1 - The Must Reads

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1745" title="insite_must_reads" src="{{ site.url }}/images/insite_must_reads.jpg" alt="The Must Read Section" /></div>

The Must Read section is a great way to control which articles of your blog your users read. One of the many problems that blogs face is that they are constantly being updated with new articles. This can leave some of your greatest articles in the dust. To prevent this from happening, create a Must Read's section and show off your best work.

### Option 2 - The Featured Post

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1750" title="problogger_featured_post" src="{{ site.url }}/images/problogger_featured_post.jpg" alt="" /></div>

The Featured Post is a classic for blogs. It takes care of much the same problem that Must Reads does, allowing you to keep one of your favorite posts on top. <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">Problogger</a> ( as seen in the above picture ) gets about 10 times as many comments on a featured post than a non-featured.

### Option 3 - Supercharged Categories

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1753" title="pearsonified_supercharged_categories" src="{{ site.url }}/images/pearsonified_supercharged_categories.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Most blogging platforms, like WordPress, come with a built-in category system but they're usually rubbish. Most people don't want to know how many posts you have in each and every category you've created. The sooner you ditch that type of bloated category system the better. I recommend you replace it with a **Supercharged Category System** like <a href="http://www.pearsonified.com/">Pearsonified</a> uses. Instead of a boring and sometimes overwhelming list like WordPress comes with by default, use your sidebar to display categories like "Improve Your Business", "Make Money Online" and "Marketing Secrets".

### Option 4 - Make Your Point

Subtlety is good, but sometimes you just need to make your conversion. Never hide your buy button. Likewise, really think about the ultimate goal of your website and make it painfully easy to achieve.

If you want subscribers, customers, followers or likes. Let your users know what you want and make it easy for them to give it to you.

### Make It Easy For Your Users

The web is a complicated place. And most content driven websites are so full of content it's impossible to find your way. Really think about what you want your user's experience to be and make it happen.
