Looking to have your WordPress blog automatically update your Facebook page?

Let's compare options.

tl;dr  -   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/RSS.Graffiti">Use http://www.facebook.com/RSS.Graffiti</a>

## Option 1 - Simple Facebook Connect

**What is it:** A WordPress plugin developed to allow all sorts of Facebook / WordPress connectivity.

**The Good:** It gets the job done.

**The Bad:**

+ It's a massively big plug-in.
+ It'll slow your website load by a good deal of time.
+ It's a bit difficult to set-up.

**My Experience:** When I was first looking to accomplish this functionality. This was the only option that I saw on the market. I downloaded and installed the plug-in, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work. Finally I found a good tutorial floating around the internet and go moving. The functionality worked just as expected. I was frustrated that I had to create my own Facebook app and a bunch of other stuff but hey, it worked.

After I got everything set and working I pretty much forgot about it for a while. Lately I've been trying to figure out how to improve my website's performance and I noticed that the four slowest things loading on my website were all related to this plugin. It was pushing me to an unacceptable about of lag so I had to look for other options.

## Option 2 - RSS Graffiti

**What is it:** A Facebook app that takes data from your RSS feed and pushes it to your Facebook wall.

*RSS feeds are automatically generated by WordPress. They can be found at http://www.yourwebsite.com/feed.
*This plug-in can post to your personal wall or a fan page.

**The Good:** Super easy and it gets the job done.

**The Bad:** Nothing so far. I mean it doesn't slow down your website because it doesn't go on your website. I'll update if I get frustrated and switch again.

## Option 3 - Networked Blogs

I don't know if it's just me but I can not bring myself to use Networked Blogs. Maybe it's just me but I can't get past the sign up screen. Anyone have experience with this method and want to share let me know and I'll add it to the post!
