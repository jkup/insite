I'm starting a new section here on the Insite Design Lab Blog called **Decision Time**

It's going to be a running meme where I write about decisions I'm constantly flip-flopping between. This first segment is going to be:

### Decision Time - What Is The Best Web Browser

I recently wrote a blog post <a title="What Is The Best Web Browser" href="http://www.insitedesignlab.com/what-is-the-best-web-browser/">comparing the different web browsers</a> in a general sense. This post is about which web browser is my personal favorite and why I have such a difficult time deciding on just one.

## The Contenders

To be totally honest there are only ever two web browsers that contend for the *top spot* in my book.

+ **Google Chrome**
+ **Mozilla FireFox**

I constantly go back and forth between the two of them, and I'm never sure which one to consider my absolute favorite.

## The Runners Up

Although they never make it to my top-spot, there are two browsers which deserve honorable mention.

+ **Apple Safari**
+ **The Opera Browser**

**Apple Safari - **The only reason I'm really giving Safari the honorable mention is because of screenshots. If I'm making a blog post, presentation or tutorial, nothing looks quite as sharp as a screenshot taken on a Mac, using Safari. It's a really sleek looking browsers and despite not being on my favorites list, it's a necessary part of my arsenal.

**The Opera Browser -** RSS Feeds are something I've always struggled with. I read **a lot** of blogs every day and I'd love to have an easy way to aggregate them all together.

## The Tough Call

**Mozilla FireFox:**

+ Amazing features
+ Firebug for development
+ Fantastic looks
+ Great add-ons

**Google Chrome:**

+ Blazing fast speeds
+ The latest features
+ not-as-good but still awesome developer tools and extensions

## The Question

What are your favorite browsers and why do you think they're better than the rest?

How often do you switch between browsers and why?
