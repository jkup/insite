Cold calls, email blasts, commercials and radio shout-outs are a thing of the past.

When paying for outbound marketing methods  such as these, there are far too many pitfalls that may render your efforts worthless. Examples include:

+ Caller ID, Mute Buttons and AD Blockers often render these tactics completely ineffective.
+ Even if you do the correct research, these methods don't attract pre-qualified leads

Living in a world completely saturated with advertisements, it's difficult for one particular ad to penetrate and be truly effective.

### **Inbound Marketing To The Rescue**

It is for this reason that you should shift your focus towards inbound marketing. Publishing genuinely valuable information on your website will help generate premium, pre-qualified leads and here is how:

+ You become an authority in your field.
+ Potential clients will associate you with your topic or service.
+ You'll be able to network well with others in your industry.

#### **The New Customer Mindset** 

In this day and age, customers are particularly disinterested in outbound marketing methods such as cold calling because of the internet. They don't want to be bothered with weighing the pros and cons of a decision before that product or service is a necessity.

*I don't want to think about who is going to do my taxes until the year is up.*

When a need arises for a particular good or service, customers go to their computers, type in a customized search query and start looking for someone to fill that need. This is where you, and your inbound marketing efforts come in.

### **A Simple Truth**

Say I'm looking for a lawn care service in Michigan. I'm going to sit down at my laptop, head to Google and type a search query like this:

**Best Lawn Care Service In Michigan.**
Now, say my top three results look something like this:

1. *Lawn Care Company A*
2. *Lawn Care Company B*
3. *A Blog Post Comparing Michigan Lawn Care Companies*

Can you guess where I'm heading?

Why waste my time comparing lawn care companies when someone else has already done it? I'm going to head straight for the blog article and if the blog is well designed and well written, it is going to **heavily** influence my decision.

## **My Advice To Michigan Lawn Care Companies**

Write that blog post!

Seriously, if you and a competitor each have a website, offer the same service for a similar cost and don't have anything **big** that separates you from each other. Start Inbound marketing!

Create a blog, review your company as well as your competitors. Be honest, charming and provide valuable information. Save potential customers time by warning them of the pitfalls in the industry and how to get the most for their money. When they discover that the amazing resource that taught them so much so quickly also provides the service they're looking for, guess where they are likely going to do.
