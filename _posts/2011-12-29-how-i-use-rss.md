## RSS For Bloggers

As a blogger or publisher, you most likely are constantly tracking the number of RSS subscribers your blog has. Publishers tend to view RSS subscribers as a status symbol. The number of RSS subscribers you have should dictate how many people read your articles every time you publish a new one.

It's common to see popular blogs with large groups of subscribers advertise them prominently.

As with Twitter followers and Facebook fans; Once you build up enough of a following, you can leverage your impressive numbers into credibility to gain more and more followers.

All too often however, publishers fixate on the number of subscribers without considering the experience that these subscribers or potential subscribers may have.

## RSS For Subscribers

For subscribers, RSS feeds take on a different personality. Most readers don't really care about how many other people have subscribed to your feed, they care about **themselves.**

Now, I don't mean to make readers out to be terrible, selfish individuals. Only to express the fact that most people viewing a blog are sitting at home or work, relatively alone and are looking for some type of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">value</span>.

### Value - The Million Dollar Buzzword

There are essentially two reasons people subscribe to a blog:

1. They honestly want to stay up to date with everything you write
2. You are offering something they want in return for their subscription

**Case 1 - You Have Awesome Content And Don't Need To Bribe Your Readers**

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="awesome_website_with_high_rss" src="{{ site.url }}/images/awesome_website_with_high_rss.jpg" alt="" /></div>

If you have a lot of great content and people genuinely want to stay up to date with what you have to say. You can put your RSS link wherever you want -- People will subscribe.

**Case 2 - You Gotta Give 'Em Something**

<div class="img-wrap"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1818" title="make_people_subscribe" src="{{ site.url }}/images/make_people_subscribe.jpg" alt="" /></div>

Just for the record -- Vandelay Design is one of my favorite blogs on the internet. I'm not implying that they **need** to give bundles away in order to get subscribers. They just happen to be a prime example of providing real value to their subscribers.

## How To Get RSS Subscribers
