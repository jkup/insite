Have Your WordPress Pages Disappeared?

This How-To is for people who have just moved a WordPress website from one server to another and have come to find that their posts and pages have disappeared. I just moved a full WordPress website from a Dreamhost account to a GoDaddy account and had this happen.

## What To Do

If you're having a similar experience and your WordPress pages have disappeared, try doing the following:

1. Log In to the new WordPress Dashboard
2. Click Settings -&gt; Permalinks
3. Change the Permalink Structure back to Default
4. Check to see if your pages are back!
5. *optional* If you'd like, you should be able to change your permalink structure back to whatever it is you desire

I hope this helps!
