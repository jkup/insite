		<h1>Hello. My Name Is Jon Kuperman.</h1>

		<h3>I Love WordPress, Web Design, Blogging, Search Engine Optimization and All Things Technology.</h3>

		<p>I started developing websites in 2010 and haven't looked back. I read blogs all day and write blogs all night. I love building websites, especially in WordPress and I get a lot of joy out of teaching what I know to others.</p>

		<p>I'm really interested in Responsive Web Design, People Who Start Their Own Businesses, and Prolific Bloggers.</p>

		<p>My ambitions are to:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Become An Expert Blogger</li>
			<li>One Day Work On The WordPress Core Development Team</li>
			<li>Build A Lot Of Super Cool Web Applications</li>
			<li>Contribute To Open Source Projects Like jQuery and WordPress</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Interested in collaborating on a project together or just want to talk? Email me @ jon [at] insitedesignlab.com and we'll talk!</p>
