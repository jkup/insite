# Hello. My Name Is Jon Kuperman.

### I Love WordPress, Web Design, Blogging, Search Engine Optimization and All Things Technology.

I started developing websites in 2010 and haven't looked back. I read blogs all day and write blogs all night. I love building websites, especially in WordPress and I get a lot of joy out of teaching what I know to others.

I'm really interested in Responsive Web Design, People Who Start Their Own Businesses, and Prolific Bloggers.

My ambitions are to:

+ Become An Expert Blogger
+ One Day Work On The WordPress Core Development Team
+ Build A Lot Of Super Cool Web Applications
+ Contribute To Open Source Projects Like jQuery and WordPress

Interested in collaborating on a project together or just want to talk? Email me @ jon [at] insitedesignlab.com and we'll talk!
